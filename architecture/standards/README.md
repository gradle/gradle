## Architecture Standards

**Experimental!**

We'd like to capture our architectural decisions about the build tool as [Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)](https://adr.github.io/).
For now we just have this global repository of ADRs.
If we see fit, we can break these out to per-platform ones, or keep a hybrid approach to having global and platform-specific ADSs.

Our aim is to keep the process lightweight and approachable.

For this reason we adopt a [lightweight Markdown ADR template](0001-use-architectural-decision-records.md#format).
