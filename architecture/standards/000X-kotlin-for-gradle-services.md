# ADR-000X - Implement Gradle services in Kotlin

## Date

2025-XX-XX

## Context

Gradle has some services implemented in Kotlin, in addition to Java.

We must provide guidance on:
- when to prefer Kotlin to Java, and vice versa
- whether to use Kotlin for defining service interfaces (which must be consumable by Java clients), or only implementation of service should happen in Kotlin, and Java for interfaces. 
- whether to mix Kotlin and Java sources in given module

## Decision

TBD

## Status

WIP

## Consequences

-
