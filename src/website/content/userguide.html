<h1>Userguide</h1>

PLEASE NOTE! The userguide refers often to Gradle's javadoc to get detail information. Gradle is written in Groovy,
therefore we need to use the GroovyDoc tool to generate the api documentation. GroovyDoc is work in progress. For
example properties are not processed yet. Right now you might have to directly look into the source code to get the
information you want. You might use <a href="http://svn.gradle.codehaus.org">Fisheye</a> for this. The source code is
also part of the Gradle distribution. - Apologies for the inconvenience   
<p>
PLEASE NOTE! The layout of the pdf version is much nicer compared to the html version.
