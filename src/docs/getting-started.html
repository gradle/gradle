<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
Gradle requires a Java JDK and a JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to the JDK. Gradle ships with its own Groovy
library. Therefore no Groovy needs to be installed. Any existing Groovy installation is ignored by Gradle.
<h2>Unpacking</h2>
The Gradle distribution comes only as zip. Additional to the binaries it is shipped with:
<ul>
<li>The userguide (HTML and PDF)</li>
<li>The Javadoc HTML pages.</li>
<li>The binary sources (If you want to build Gradle you need to download the source distribution or checkout the sources from the source repository)</li>
</ul>

<h3>For Un*x users</h3>
You need a GNU compatible tool to unzip Gradle, if you want the file permissions to be properly set. We mention this as
some zip front ends for Mac OS X don't restore the file permissions properly.

<h2>Environment variables</h2>
For running Gradle, the GRADLE_HOME environment variable needs to point to the root directory of your Gradle installation.

<h2>Testing your installation</h2>
To check if Gradle is properly installed just type <pre>gradle -v</pre> and you should get an output like:
<pre>
    Modern compiler found.
    Gradle 0.2-080409092233+0200
    Gradle buildtime: Wednesday, April 9, 2008 9:22:33 AM CEST

</pre>
<h2>Getting Help</h2>
You might check the userguide at <em>GRADLE_HOME</em><code>/docs/userguide</code>. Typing <code>gradle -h</code> prints
the command line help. Typing <code>gradle -t</code> shows all the tasks of a gradle build.
