// This file contains a mixture of messages emitted by various sampling
// profilers:
//
// Memory allocator profiling
// ----------------
// ProfilePacket:
//   The packet emitted by heapprofd, which started off as a native heap
//   (malloc/free) profiler, but now supports custom allocators as well. Each
//   packet contains a preaggregated state of the heap at snapshot time, which
//   report the total allocated/free bytes per callstack (plus other info such
//   as the number of samples).
// StreamingAllocation/StreamingFree:
//   Emitted by heapprofd when configured in streaming mode (i.e. when
//   stream_allocations = true). This is only for local testing, and doesn't
//   report callstacks (only address time and size of each alloc/free). It can
//   lead to enormous traces, as it contains the stream of each alloc/free call.
//
// Callstack sampling
// ------------------
// StreamingProfilePacket:
//   The packet emitted by the chromium in-process sampling profiler, which is
//   based on periodically sending a signal to itself, and unwinding the stack
//   in the signal handler. Each packet contains a series of individual stack
//   samples for a Chromium thread.
//
// Callstack and performance counter sampling
// ---------------------
// PerfSample:
//   The packet emitted by traced_perf sampling performance profiler based on
//   the perf_event_open syscall. Each packet represents an individual sample
//   of a performance counter (which might be a timer), and optionally a
//   callstack of the process that was scheduled at the time of the sample.
//

// The packet emitted by heapprofd for each heap snapshot. A snapshot can
// involve more than one ProfilePacket if the snapshot is big (when |continued|
// is true). The cardinality and grouping is as follows:
// A ProfilePacket contains:
//  - 1+ per-process heap snapshots (ProcessHeapSamples). Normally there is only
//    one heap per process (the main malloc/free heap), but there can be more if
//    the process is using the heapprofd API to profile custom allocators.
//  - Globally interned strings, mappings and frames (to allow de-duplicating
//    frames/mapping in common between different processes).
// A ProcessHeapSamples contains:
//  - The process and heap identifier.
//  - A number of HeapSample, one for each callsite that had some alloc/frees.
//  - Statistics about heapprofd internals (e.g., sampling/unwinding timings).
// A HeapSample contains statistics about callsites:
//  - Total number of bytes allocated and freed from that callsite.
//  - Total number of alloc/free calls sampled.
//  - Stats at the local maximum when dump_at_max = true.
// See https://perfetto.dev/docs/data-sources/native-heap-profiler for more.
