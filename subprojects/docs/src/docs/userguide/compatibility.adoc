= Compatibility Matrix
The sections below describe Gradle's compatibility with several integrations. Other versions not listed here may or may not work.

== Java
A Java version between 8 and 17 is required to execute Gradle. Java 18 and later versions are not yet supported.

Java 6 and 7 can still be used for <<building_java_projects.adoc#sec:java_cross_compilation,compilation and forked test execution>>.

Any supported version of Java can be used for compile or test.

Gradle plugins written in Groovy must use Groovy 3.x for compatibility with Gradle and Groovy DSL build scripts.
