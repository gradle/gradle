[[upgrading_version_8]]
= Upgrading your build from Gradle 8.x to the latest

This chapter provides the information you need to migrate your Gradle 8.x builds to the latest Gradle release.
For migrating from Gradle 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, or 7.x, see the <<upgrading_version_7.adoc#upgrading_version_7, older migration guide>> first.

We recommend the following steps for all users:

. Try running `gradle help --scan` and view the https://gradle.com/enterprise/releases/2018.4/#identify-usages-of-deprecated-gradle-functionality[deprecations view] of the generated build scan.
+
image::deprecations.png[Deprecations View of a Gradle Build Scan]
+
This is so you can see any deprecation warnings that apply to your build.
+
Alternatively, you can run `gradle help --warning-mode=all` to see the deprecations in the console, though it may not report as much detailed information.
. Update your plugins.
+
Some plugins will break with this new version of Gradle, for example because they use internal APIs that have been removed or changed.
The previous step will help you identify potential problems by issuing deprecation warnings when a plugin does try to use a deprecated part of the API.
+
. Run `gradle wrapper --gradle-version {gradleVersion}` to update the project to {gradleVersion}.
. Try to run the project and debug any errors using the <<troubleshooting.adoc#troubleshooting, Troubleshooting Guide>>.

[[changes_8.5]]
== Upgrading from 8.4 and earlier

=== Potential breaking changes

==== Changes to `JavaBasePlugin` conventions

The `java-base` plugin now assumes a maximum of one `link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/jvm/component/internal/JvmSoftwareComponentInternal.html[JvmSoftwareComponentInternal]` component will ever be created.
The plugin's `java` extension block will now apply source and target compatibility versions and consistent resolution settings to every such component.
Previously, the plugin would only apply these settings to component named `java`.

As there is no public API for creating components of this type, we do not expect this change to affect many builds.

Additionally, the `groovy-base` plugin will now be responsible for configuring source and target compatibility version conventions on any `GroovyCompile` tasks.

If you are using this task *without applying this plugin*, you will have to manually set compatibility versions on these tasks.

[[changes_8.4]]
== Upgrading from 8.3 and earlier

=== Potential breaking changes

==== Upgrade to Kotlin 1.9.10

The embedded Kotlin has been updated to link:https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.9.10[Kotlin 1.9.10].

==== XML parsing now requires recent parsers

Gradle 8.4 now configures XML parsers with security features enabled.
If your build logic has dependencies on old XML parsers that don't support secure parsing, your build may now fail.
If you encounter a failure, check and update or remove any dependency on legacy XML parsers.


==== EAR plugin with customized JEE 1.3 descriptor

Gradle 8.4 forbids external XML entities when parsing XML documents.
If you use the EAR plugin and configure the `application.xml` descriptor via the EAR plugin's DSL and customize the descriptor using `withXml {}` and use `asElement{}` in the customization block, then the build will now fail for security reasons.

    deploymentDescriptor {
        version = "1.3"

        }
    }

        }
    }
}
----
======
=====

If you happen to use `asNode()` instead of `asElement()` then nothing changes given `asNode()` simply ignores external DTDs.

You can work around this by running your build with the `javax.xml.accessExternalDTD` system property set to `http`.

On the command line, add this to your Gradle invocation:

[source]
----
-Djavax.xml.accessExternalDTD=http
----

To make this workaround persistent, add the following line to your `gradle.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
systemProp.javax.xml.accessExternalDTD=http
----

Note that this will enable HTTP access to external DTDs for the whole build JVM.

=== Deprecations

[[generate_maven_pom_method_deprecations]]
==== Deprecated `GenerateMavenPom` methods

The following methods on `link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/publish/maven/tasks/GenerateMavenPom.html[GenerateMavenPom]` are deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 9.0.
They were never intended to be public API.

- `getVersionRangeMapper`
- `withCompileScopeAttributes`
- `withRuntimeScopeAttributes`

[[changes_8.3]]
== Upgrading from 8.2 and earlier

=== Potential breaking changes

==== Deprecated `Project.buildDir` can cause script compilation failure

With the deprecation of `Project.buildDir`, buildscripts that are compiled with warnings as errors could fail if the deprecated field is used.

See <<#project_builddir, the deprecation entry>> for details.

==== `TestLauncher` API no longer ignores build failures

The `TestLauncher` interface is part of the Tooling API, specialized for running tests.
It is a logical extension of the `BuildLauncher` that can only launch tasks.
A discrepancy has been reported in their behavior: if the same failing test is executed, `BuildLauncher` will report a build failure but `TestLauncher` won't.
Originally, this was a design decision in order to continue the execution and run the tests in all test tasks and not stop at the first failure.
At the same time, this behavior can be confusing for users as they can experience a failing test in a successful build.
To make the two APIs more uniform, we made `TestLauncher` also fail the build, which is a potential breaking change.
To continue the test execution even if a test task failed, Tooling API clients should explicitly pass `--continue` to the build.

[[legacy_attribute_snapshotting]]
==== Fixed variant selection behavior with `ArtifactView` and `ArtifactCollection`

The dependency resolution APIs for selecting different artifacts or files (`Configuration.getIncoming().artifactView { }` and `Configuration.getIncoming().getArtifacts()`) captured immutable copies of the underlying `Configuration`'s attributes to use for variant selection.
If the `Configuration`'s attributes were changed after these methods were called, the artifacts selected by these methods could be unexpected.

Consider the case where the set of attributes on a `Configuration` is changed after an `ArtifactView` is created.
====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
tasks {
    myTask {
        inputFiles.from(configurations.classpath.incoming.artifactView {
            attributes {
                // Add attributes to select a different type of artifact
            }
        }.files)
    }
}

configurations {
    classpath {
        attributes {
            // Add more attributes to the configuration
        }
    }
}

----
=====
====

The `inputFiles` property of `myTask` uses an artifact view to select a different type of artifact from the configuration `classpath`.
Since the artifact view was created before the attributes were added to the configuration, Gradle was not able to select the correct artifact.

Some builds may have worked around this by also putting the additional attributes into the artifact view. This is no longer necessary.

[[kotlin_1_9.0]]
==== Upgrade to Kotlin 1.9.0

The embedded Kotlin has been updated from 1.8.20 to link:https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.9.0[Kotlin 1.9.0].
The Kotlin language and API levels for the Kotlin DSL are still set to 1.8 for backwards compatibility.
See the release notes for link:https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.8.22[Kotlin 1.8.22] and link:https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.8.21[Kotlin 1.8.21].

Kotlin 1.9 dropped support for Kotlin language and API level 1.3.
If you build Gradle plugins written in Kotlin with this version of Gradle and need to support Gradle <7.0 you need to stick to using the Kotlin Gradle Plugin <1.9.0 and configure the Kotlin language and API levels to 1.3.
See the <<compatibility.adoc#compatibility, Compatibility Matrix>> for details about other versions.

==== Eager evaluation of `Configuration` attributes

Gradle 8.3 updates the `org.gradle.libraryelements` and `org.gradle.jvm.version` attributes of JVM Configurations to be present at the time of creation, as opposed to previously, where they were only present after the Configuration had been resolved or consumed.
In particular, the value for `org.gradle.jvm.version` relies on the project's configured toolchain, meaning that querying the value for this attribute will finalize the value of the project's Java toolchain.

Plugins or build logic that eagerly queries the attributes of JVM configurations may now cause the project's Java toolchain to be finalized earlier than before.
Attempting to modify the toolchain after it has been finalized will result in error messages similar to the following:
```
The value for property 'implementation' is final and cannot be changed any further.
The value for property 'languageVersion' is final and cannot be changed any further.
The value for property 'vendor' is final and cannot be changed any further.
```

This situation may arise when plugins or build logic eagerly queries an existing JVM Configuration's attributes to create a new Configuration with the same attributes.
Previously, this logic would have omitted the two above noted attributes entirely, while now the same logic will copy the attributes and finalize the project's Java toolchain.
To avoid early toolchain finalization, attribute-copying logic should be updated to query the source Configuration's attributes lazily:

    create("customRuntimeClasspath") {

=== Deprecations

[[project_builddir]]
==== Deprecated `Project.buildDir` is to be replaced by `Project.layout.buildDirectory`

The `Project.buildDir` property is deprecated.
It uses eager APIs and has ordering issues if the value is read in build logic and then later modified.
It could result in outputs ending up in different locations.

It is replaced by a `link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/DirectoryProperty.html[DirectoryProperty]` found at `Project.layout.buildDirectory`.
See the `link:{dslPath}/org.gradle.api.file.ProjectLayout.html[ProjectLayout]` interface for details.

Note that, at this stage, Gradle will not print deprecation warnings if you still use `Project.buildDir`.
We know this is a big change and want to give time for authors of major plugins to move away from its usage first.

The switch from a `File` to a `DirectoryProperty` requires adaptations in build logic.
The main impact is that you cannot use the property inside a `String` to expand it.
Instead, you should leverage the `dir` and `file` methods to compute the location you want.

Here is an example for creating a file, where the following:

=====
[.multi-language-sample]
======
.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
// Returns a java.io.File
file("$buildDir/myOutput.txt")
----
======
[.multi-language-sample]

----
// Compatible with a number of Gradle lazy APIs that accept also java.io.File
val output: Provider<RegularFile> = layout.buildDirectory.file("myOutput.txt")

// If you really need the java.io.File for a non lazy API
output.get().asFile

// Or a path for a lazy String based API
output.map { it.asFile.path }

==== Deprecated `ClientModule` dependencies

`link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/ClientModule.html[ClientModule]` dependencies are deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 9.0.

Client module dependencies were originally intended to allow builds to override incorrect or missing component metadata of external dependencies by defining the metadata locally.
This functionality has since been replaced by <<component_metadata_rules.adoc#sec:component_metadata_rules,Component Metadata Rules>>.

Consider the following client module dependency example:

=====
[.multi-language-sample]
======
.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
dependencies {
    implementation(module("org:foo:1.0") {
        dependency("org:bar:1.0")
        module("org:baz:1.0") {
            dependency("com:example:1.0")
        }
    })
}
----
======
[.multi-language-sample]
======
.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    implementation module("org:foo:1.0") {
        dependency "org:bar:1.0"
        module("org:baz:1.0") {
            dependency "com:example:1.0"
        }
    }
}
----
======

This can be replaced with the following component metadata rule:

Starting in Gradle 9.0, the earliest supported Gradle Enterprise plugin version is 3.13.1.
The plugin versions from 3.0 up to 3.13 will be ignored when applied.

Upgrade to version 3.13.1 or later of the Gradle Enterprise plugin.
You can find the link:https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.enterprise[latest available version on the Gradle Plugin Portal].
More information on the compatibility can be found link:https://docs.gradle.com/enterprise/compatibility/#build_scans[here].

[[changes_8.2]]
== Upgrading from 8.1 and earlier

=== Potential breaking changes

[[kotlin_1_8.20]]
==== Upgrade to Kotlin 1.8.20

The embedded Kotlin has been updated to link:https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v1.8.20[Kotlin 1.8.20].
For more information, see https://kotlinlang.org/docs/whatsnew1820.html[What's new in Kotlin 1.8.20].

Note that there is a known issue with Kotlin compilation avoidance that can cause `OutOfMemory` exceptions in `compileKotlin` tasks if the compilation classpath contains very large JAR files.
This applies to builds applying the Kotlin plugin v1.8.20 or the `kotlin-dsl` plugin.

You can work around it by disabling Kotlin compilation avoidance in your `gradle.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
kotlin.incremental.useClasspathSnapshot=false
----

See link:https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-57757/[KT-57757] for more information.

==== Upgrade to Groovy 3.0.17

Groovy has been updated to https://groovy-lang.org/changelogs/changelog-3.0.17.html[Groovy 3.0.17].

Since the previous version was 3.0.15, the https://groovy-lang.org/changelogs/changelog-3.0.16.html[3.0.16] changes are also included.

==== Upgrade to Ant 1.10.13

Ant has been updated to https://github.com/apache/ant/blob/rel/1.10.13/WHATSNEW[Ant 1.10.13].

Since the previous version was 1.10.11, the https://github.com/apache/ant/blob/rel/1.10.12/WHATSNEW[1.10.12] changes are also included.

==== Upgrade to CodeNarc 3.2.0

The default version of CodeNarc has been updated to https://github.com/CodeNarc/CodeNarc/blob/v3.2.0/CHANGELOG.md#version-320----jan-2023[CodeNarc 3.2.0].

==== Upgrade to PMD 6.55.0

PMD has been updated to https://docs.pmd-code.org/pmd-doc-6.55.0/pmd_release_notes.html[PMD 6.55.0].

Since the previous version was 6.48.0, all changes since then are included.

==== Upgrade to JaCoCo 0.8.9

JaCoCo has been updated to https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/changes.html[0.8.9].

==== Plugin compatibility changes

A plugin compiled with Gradle >= 8.2 that makes use of the Kotlin DSL functions link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.kotlin.dsl/the.html[`Project.the<T>()`], link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.kotlin.dsl/the.html[`Project.the(KClass)`] or link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.kotlin.dsl/configure.html[`Project.configure<T> {}`] cannot run on Gradle <= 6.1.

==== Deferred or avoided configuration of some tasks

When performing dependency resolution, Gradle creates an internal representation of the available link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/Configuration.html[Configuration]s.
This requires inspecting all configurations and artifacts.
Processing artifacts created by tasks causes those tasks to be realized and configured.

This internal representation is now created more lazily, which can change the order in which tasks are configured.
Some tasks may never be configured.

This change may cause code paths that relied on a particular order to no longer function, such as conditionally adding attributes to a configuration based on the presence of certain attributes.

This impacted the link:https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/issues/5695[bnd plugin and JUnit5 build].

We recommend not modifying domain objects (configurations, source sets, tasks, etc) from configuration blocks for other domain objects that may not be configured.

For example, avoid doing something like this:

```kotlin
    configurations {
        val myConfig = create("myConfig")
    }

    tasks.register("myTask") {
            // This is not safe, as the execution of this block may not occur, or may not occur in the order expected
          configurations["myConfig"].attributes {
              attribute(Usage.USAGE_ATTRIBUTE, objects.named(Usage::class.java, Usage.JAVA_RUNTIME))
          }
    }
```

=== Deprecations

[[compile_options_generated_sources_directory]]
==== `link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/compile/CompileOptions.html[CompileOptions]` method deprecations

The following methods on `CompileOptions` are deprecated:

- `getAnnotationProcessorGeneratedSourcesDirectory()`
- `setAnnotationProcessorGeneratedSourcesDirectory(File)`
- `setAnnotationProcessorGeneratedSourcesDirectory(Provider<File>)`

Current usages of these methods should migrate to `link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/compile/CompileOptions.html#getGeneratedSourceOutputDirectory--[DirectoryProperty getGeneratedSourceOutputDirectory()]`

[[deprecated_configuration_usage]]
==== Using configurations incorrectly

Gradle will now warn at runtime when methods of link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/Configuration.html--[Configuration] are called inconsistently with the configuration's intended usage.

This change is part of a larger ongoing effort to make the intended behavior of configurations more consistent and predictable, and to unlock further speed and memory improvements.

Currently, the following methods should only be called with these listed allowed usages:

- `resolve()` - RESOLVABLE configurations only
- `files(Closure)`, `files(Spec)`, `files(Dependency…)`, `fileCollection(Spec)`, `fileCollection(Closure)`, `fileCollection(Dependency…)` - RESOLVABLE configurations only
- `getResolvedConfigurations()` - RESOLVABLE configurations only
- `defaultDependencies(Action)` - DECLARABLE configurations only
- `shouldResolveConsistentlyWith(Configuration)` - RESOLVABLE configurations only
- `disableConsistentResolution()` - RESOLVABLE configurations only
- `getDependencyConstraints()` - DECLARABLE configurations only
- `copy()`, `copy(Spec)`, `copy(Closure)`, `copyRecursive()`, `copyRecursive(Spec)`, `copyRecursive(Closure)` - RESOLVABLE configurations only

Intended usage is noted in the `Configuration` interface's Javadoc.
This list is likely to grow in future releases.

Starting in Gradle 9.0, using a configuration inconsistently with its intended usage will be prohibited.

Also note that although it is not currently restricted, the `getDependencies()` method is really only intended for use with DECLARABLE configurations.
The `getAllDependencies()` method, which retrieves all declared dependencies on a configuration and any superconfigurations, will not be restricted to any particular usage.

[[deprecated_access_to_conventions]]
==== Deprecated access to plugin conventions

The concept of conventions is outdated and superseded by <<implementing_gradle_plugins.adoc#modeling_dsl_like_apis, extensions>> to provide custom DSLs.

To reflect this in the Gradle API, the following elements are deprecated:

- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Project.html#getConvention--[org.gradle.api.Project.getConvention()]
- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/plugins/Convention.html[org.gradle.api.plugins.Convention]
- `org.gradle.api.internal.HasConvention`

Gradle Core plugins still register their conventions in addition to their extensions for backwards compatibility.

It is deprecated to access any of these conventions and their properties.
Doing so will now emit a deprecation warning.
This will become an error in Gradle 9.0.
You should prefer accessing the extensions and their properties instead.

For specific examples see the next sections.

Prominent community plugins already migrated to using extensions to provide custom DSLs.
Some of them still registers conventions for backwards compatibility.
Registering conventions does not emit a deprecation warning yet to provide a migration window.
Future Gradle versions will do.

Also note that Plugins compiled with Gradle <= 8.1 that make use of the Kotlin DSL functions link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.kotlin.dsl/the.html[`Project.the<T>()`], link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.kotlin.dsl/the.html[`Project.the(KClass)`] or link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.kotlin.dsl/configure.html[`Project.configure<T> {}`] will emit a deprecation warning when run on Gradle >= 8.2.
To fix this these plugins should be recompiled with Gradle >= 8.2 or changed to access extensions directly using `extensions.getByType<T>()` instead.

[[base_convention_deprecation]]
==== Deprecated `base` plugin conventions

The convention properties contributed by the `base` plugin have been deprecated and scheduled for removal in Gradle 9.0.
For the wider context see the <<deprecated_access_to_conventions, section about plugin convention deprecation>>.

The conventions are replaced by the `base { }` configuration block backed by link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.plugins.BasePluginExtension.html[BasePluginExtension].
The old convention object defines the `distsDirName`, `libsDirName` and `archivesBaseName` properties with simple getter and setter methods.
Those methods are available in the extension only to maintain backwards compatibility.
Build scripts should solely use the properties of type `Property`:

[[redundant_configuration_usage_activation]]
==== Redundant configuration usage activation

Calling `setCanBeConsumed(boolean)` or `setCanBeResolved(boolean)` on a configuration that already allows that usage is deprecated.

This deprecation is intended to help users identify unnecessary configuration usage modifications.

[[deprecated_configuration_get_all]]
==== `link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/Configuration.html[Configuration]` method deprecations

The following method on `Configuration` is deprecated for removal:

- `getAll()`

Obtain the set of all configurations from the project's `configurations` container instead.

[[test_framework_implementation_dependencies]]
==== Relying on automatic test framework implementation dependencies

In some cases, Gradle will load JVM test framework dependencies from the Gradle distribution in order to
execute tests.
This existing behavior can lead to test framework dependency version conflicts on the test
classpath.
To avoid these conflicts, this behavior is deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 9.0. Tests
using TestNG are unaffected.

In order to prepare for this change in behavior, either declare the required dependencies explicitly,
or migrate to link:jvm_test_suite_plugin.html[Test Suites], where these dependencies are managed automatically.

===== Test Suites

Builds that use test suites will not be affected by this change.
Test suites manage the test
framework dependencies automatically and do not require dependencies to be explicitly declared.
See link:jvm_test_suite_plugin.html[the user manual] for further information on migrating to test suites.

===== Manually declaring dependencies

In the absence of test suites, dependencies must be manually declared on the test runtime classpath:

  * If using JUnit 5, an explicit `runtimeOnly` dependency on `junit-platform-launcher` is required
  in addition to the existing `implementation` dependency on the test engine.
  * If using JUnit 4, only the existing `implementation` dependency on `junit` 4 is required.
  * If using JUnit 3, a test `runtimeOnly` dependency on `junit` 4 is required in addition to a
  `compileOnly` dependency on `junit` 3.

[[build_identifier_name_and_current_deprecation]]
==== `link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/component/BuildIdentifier.html[BuildIdentifier]` and `link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/component/ProjectComponentSelector.html[ProjectComponentSelector]` method deprecations

The following methods on `BuildIdentifier` are deprecated:

- `getName()`
- `isCurrentBuild()`

You could use these methods to distinguish between different project components with the same name but from different builds.
However, for certain composite build setups, these methods do not provide enough information to guarantee uniqueness.

Current usages of these methods should migrate to `link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/component/BuildIdentifier.html#getBuildPath--[BuildIdentifier.getBuildPath()]`.

Similarly, the method `ProjectComponentSelector.getBuildName()` is deprecated.
Use `link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/component/ProjectComponentSelector.html#getBuildPath--[ProjectComponentSelector.getBuildPath()]` instead.

[[cache_marking]]
=== CACHEDIR.TAG files are created in global cache directories
Gradle now emits a `CACHEDIR.TAG` file in some global cache directories, as specified in <<directory_layout#dir:gradle_user_home:cache_marking>>.

This may cause these directories to no longer be searched or backed up by some tools. To disable it, use the following code in an <<init_scripts#sec:using_an_init_script,init script>> in the Gradle User Home:

[[configuration_caching_options_renamed]]
=== Configuration cache options renamed

In this release, the configuration cache feature was promoted from incubating to stable, and as such, all properties
originally mentioned in the feature documentation (which had an `unsafe` part in their names, e.g. `org.gradle.unsafe.configuration-cache`) were renamed, in some cases, by just removing the `unsafe` bit.

[cols="1,1", options="header"]
|===

| Incubating property
| Finalized property

|`org.gradle.unsafe.configuration-cache`
|`org.gradle.configuration-cache`

|`org.gradle.unsafe.configuration-cache-problems`
|`org.gradle.configuration-cache.problems`*

|`org.gradle.unsafe.configuration-cache.max-problems`
|`org.gradle.configuration-cache.max-problems`
|===

Note that the original `org.gradle.unsafe.configuration-cache...` properties continue to be honored in this release,
and no warnings will be produced if they are used, but they will be deprecated and removed in a future release.

=== Potential breaking changes

==== Kotlin DSL scripts emit compilation warnings

Compilation warnings from Kotlin DSL scripts are printed to the console output.
For example, the use of deprecated APIs in Kotlin DSL will emit warnings each time the script is compiled.

This is a potentially breaking change if you are consuming the console output of Gradle builds.

==== Configuring Kotlin compiler options with the `kotlin-dsl` plugin applied

If you are configuring custom Kotlin compiler options on a project with the <<kotlin_dsl.adoc#sec:kotlin-dsl_plugin, kotlin-dsl>> plugin applied you might encounter a breaking change.

In previous Gradle versions, the `kotlin-dsl` plugin was adding required compiler arguments on link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Project.html#afterEvaluate-org.gradle.api.Action-[afterEvaluate {}].
Now that the Kotlin Gradle Plugin provides <<lazy_configuration.adoc#lazy_configuration, lazy configuration>> properties, our `kotlin-dsl` plugin switched to adding required compiler arguments to the lazy properties directly.
As a consequence, if you were setting `freeCompilerArgs` the `kotlin-dsl` plugin is now failing the build because its required compiler arguments are overridden by your configuration.

====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {
    `kotlin-dsl`
}

tasks.withType(KotlinCompile::class).configureEach {
    kotlinOptions { // Deprecated non-lazy configuration options
        freeCompilerArgs = listOf("-Xcontext-receivers")
    }
}
----
=====
====

With the configuration above you would get the following build failure:

[source,text]
----
* What went wrong
Execution failed for task ':compileKotlin'.
> Kotlin compiler arguments of task ':compileKotlin' do not work for the `kotlin-dsl` plugin. The 'freeCompilerArgs' property has been reassigned. It must instead be appended to. Please use 'freeCompilerArgs.addAll(\"your\", \"args\")' to fix this.
----

You must change this to adding your custom compiler arguments to the lazy configuration properties of the Kotlin Gradle Plugin in order for them to be appended to the ones required by the `kotlin-dsl` plugin:

====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.build.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {
    `kotlin-dsl`
}

tasks.withType(KotlinCompile::class).configureEach {
    compilerOptions { // New lazy configuration options
        freeCompilerArgs.addAll("-Xcontext-receivers")
    }
}
----
=====
====

If you were already adding to `freeCompilerArgs` instead of setting its value, then you should not experience a build failure.

==== New API introduced may clash with existing Gradle DSL code

When a new property or method is added to an existing type in the Gradle DSL, it may clash with names already in use in user code.

When a name clash occurs, one solution is to rename the element in user code.

This is a non-exhaustive list of API additions in 8.1 that may cause name collisions with existing user code.

* link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/JavaExec.html#getJvmArguments--[`JavaExec.getJvmArguments()`]
* link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/process/JavaExecSpec.html#getJvmArguments--[`JavaExecSpec.getJvmArguments()`]

==== Using unsupported API to start external processes at configuration time is no longer allowed with the configuration cache enabled

Since Gradle 7.5, using `Project.exec`, `Project.javaexec`, and standard Java and Groovy APIs to run external processes at configuration time has been considered an error only if the <<configuration_cache.adoc#config_cache:stable,feature preview `STABLE_CONFIGURATION_CACHE`>> was enabled.
With the configuration cache promotion to a stable feature in Gradle 8.1, this error is detected regardless of the feature preview status.
The <<configuration_cache#config_cache:requirements:external_processes,configuration cache chapter>> has more details to help with the migration to the new provider-based APIs to execute external processes at configuration time.

Builds that do not use the configuration cache, or only start external processes at execution time are not affected by this change.

=== Deprecations

[[configurations_allowed_usage]]
==== Mutating core plugin configuration usage

The allowed usage of a configuration should be immutable after creation.
Mutating the allowed usage on a configuration created by a Gradle core plugin is deprecated.
This includes calling any of the following `Configuration` methods:

- `setCanBeConsumed(boolean)`
- `setCanBeResolved(boolean)`

These methods now emit deprecation warnings on these configurations, except for certain special cases which make allowances for the existing behavior of popular plugins.
This rule does not yet apply to detached configurations or configurations created
in buildscripts and third-party plugins.
Calling `setCanBeConsumed(false)` on `apiElements` or `runtimeElements`
is not yet deprecated in order to avoid warnings that would be otherwise emitted when
using select popular third-party plugins.

This change is part of a larger ongoing effort to make the intended behavior of configurations more consistent and predictable, and to unlock further speed and memory improvements in this area of Gradle.

The ability to change the allowed usage of a configuration after creation will be removed in Gradle 9.0.

[[reserved_configuration_names]]
==== Reserved configuration names

Configuration names "detachedConfiguration" and "detachedConfigurationX" (where X is any integer) are reserved for internal use when creating detached configurations.

The ability to create non-detached configurations with these names will be removed in Gradle 9.0.

[[java_extension_without_java_component]]
==== Calling select methods on the `JavaPluginExtension` without the `java` component present

Starting in Gradle 8.1, calling any of the following methods on `JavaPluginExtension` without
the presence of the default `java` component is deprecated:

- `withJavadocJar()`
- `withSourcesJar()`
- `consistentResolution(Action)`

This `java` component is added by the `JavaPlugin`, which is applied by any of the Gradle JVM plugins including:

- `java-library`
- `application`
- `groovy`
- `scala`

Starting in Gradle 9.0, calling any of the above listed methods without the presence of the default `java` component
will become an error.

[[war_plugin_configure_configurations]]
==== `WarPlugin#configureConfiguration(ConfigurationContainer)`

Starting in Gradle 8.1, calling `WarPlugin#configureConfiguration(ConfigurationContainer)` is deprecated. This method was
intended for internal use and was never intended to be used as part of the public interface.

Starting in Gradle 9.0, this method will be removed without replacement.

[[test_task_default_classpath]]
==== Relying on conventions for custom Test tasks

By default, when applying the link:java_plugin.html[`java`] plugin, the `testClassesDirs`and `classpath` of all `Test` tasks have the same convention.
Unless otherwise changed, the default behavior is to execute the tests from the default `test` link:jvm_test_suite_plugin.html[`TestSuite`] by configuring the task with the `classpath` and `testClassesDirs` from the `test` suite.
This behavior will be removed in Gradle 9.0.

While this existing default behavior is correct for the use case of executing the default unit test suite under a different environment, it does not support the use case of executing an entirely separate set of tests.

If you wish to continue including these tests, use the following code to avoid the deprecation warning in 8.1 and prepare for the behavior change in 9.0.
Alternatively, consider migrating to test suites.

[[gmm_modification_after_publication_populated]]
==== Modifying Gradle Module Metadata after a publication has been populated

Altering the link:publishing_gradle_module_metadata.html[GMM] (e.g., changing a component configuration variants) *after* a Maven or Ivy publication has been populated from their components is now deprecated.
This feature will be removed in Gradle 9.0.

Eager population of the publication can happen if the following methods are called:

* Maven
** link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/publish/maven/MavenPublication.html#getArtifacts--[MavenPublication.getArtifacts()]
* Ivy
** link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/publish/ivy/IvyPublication.html#getArtifacts--[IvyPublication.getArtifacts()]

[[org_gradle_util_reports_deprecations]]
==== Deprecated members of the `org.gradle.util` package now report their deprecation

These members will be removed in Gradle 9.0.

* `WrapUtil.toDomainObjectSet(...)`
* `GUtil.toCamelCase(...)`
* `GUtil.toLowerCase(...)`
* `ConfigureUtil`

[[ibm_semeru_should_not_be_used]]
==== Deprecated JVM vendor IBM Semeru

The enum constant `JvmVendorSpec.IBM_SEMERU` is now deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 9.0.

Please replace it by its equivalent `JvmVendorSpec.IBM` to avoid warnings and potential errors in the next major version release.

[[configuring_custom_build_layout]]
==== Setting custom build layout on `StartParameter` and `GradleBuild`

Following the <<upgrading_version_7.adoc#configuring_custom_build_layout, related previous deprecation>> of the behaviour in Gradle 7.1, it is now also deprecated to use related link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/StartParameter.html[StartParameter] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/GradleBuild.html[GradleBuild] properties.
These properties will be removed in Gradle 9.0.

Setting custom build file using link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild:buildFile[buildFile] property in link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild.html[GradleBuild] task has been deprecated.

Please use the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild:dir[dir] property instead to specify the root of the nested build.
Alternatively, consider using one of the recommended alternatives for link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.GradleBuild.html[GradleBuild] task as suggested in <<authoring_maintainable_build_scripts#sec:avoiding_use_of_gradlebuild, Avoid using the GradleBuild task type>> section.

Setting custom build layout using link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/StartParameter.html[StartParameter] methods link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/StartParameter.html#setBuildFile-java.io.File-[setBuildFile(File)] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/StartParameter.html#setSettingsFile-java.io.File-[setSettingsFile(File)] as well as the counterpart getters link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/StartParameter.html#getBuildFile--[getBuildFile()] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/StartParameter.html#getSettingsFile--[getSettingsFile()] have been deprecated.

Please use standard locations for settings and build files:

* settings file in the root of the build
* build file in the root of each subproject

[[disabling_user_home_cache_cleanup]]
==== Deprecated org.gradle.cache.cleanup property

The `org.gradle.cache.cleanup` property in `gradle.properties` under Gradle User Home has been deprecated.
Please use the <<directory_layout#dir:gradle_user_home:configure_cache_cleanup,cache cleanup DSL>> instead to disable or modify the cleanup configuration.

Since the `org.gradle.cache.cleanup` property may still be needed for older versions of Gradle, this property may still be present and no deprecation warnings will be printed as long as it is also configured via the DSL.
The DSL value will always take preference over the `org.gradle.cache.cleanup` property.
If the desired configuration is to disable cleanup for older versions of Gradle (using `org.gradle.cache.cleanup`), but to enable cleanup with the default values for Gradle versions at or above Gradle 8, then cleanup should be configured to use link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/cache/Cleanup.html#DEFAULT[Cleanup.DEFAULT]:

[no_relative_paths_for_java_executables]
==== Deprecated using relative paths to specify Java executables
Using relative file paths to point to Java executables is now deprecated and will become an error in Gradle 9.
This is done to reduce confusion about what such relative paths should resolve against.

[[task_convention]]
==== Calling `Task.getConvention()`, `Task.getExtensions()` from a task action

Calling link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Task.html#getConvention--[Task.getConvention()], link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/Task.html#getExtensions--[Task.getExtensions()] from a task action at execution time is now deprecated and will be made an error in Gradle 9.0.

See the <<configuration_cache#config_cache:requirements:disallowed_types,configuration cache chapter>> for details on how to migrate these usages to APIs that are supported by the configuration cache.

[[test_task_fail_on_no_test_executed]]
==== Deprecated running test task successfully when no test executed
Running the `Test` task successfully when no test was executed is now deprecated and will become an error in Gradle 9.
Note that it is not an error when no test sources are present, in this case the `test` task is simply skipped. It is only an error when test sources are present, but no test was selected for execution.
This is changed to avoid accidental successful test runs due to erroneous configuration.

=== Changes in the IDE integration

[[kotlin_dsl_plugins_catalogs_workaround]]
==== Workaround for false positive errors shown in Kotlin DSL `plugins {}` block using version catalog is not needed anymore

Version catalog accessors for plugin aliases in the `plugins {}` block aren't shown as errors in IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio Kotlin script editor anymore.

If you were using the `@Suppress("DSL_SCOPE_VIOLATION")` annotation as a workaround, you can now remove it.

If you were using the link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18949-gradle-libs-error-suppressor[Gradle Libs Error Suppressor] IntelliJ IDEA plugin, you can now uninstall it.

After upgrading Gradle to 8.1 you will need to clear the IDE caches and restart.

Also see <<upgrading_version_8.adoc#kotlin_dsl_deprecated_catalogs_plugins_block, the deprecated usages of version catalogs in the Kotlin DSL `plugins {}` block>> above.
