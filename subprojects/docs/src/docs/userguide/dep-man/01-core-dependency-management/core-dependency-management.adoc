== What is dependency management?

Software projects rarely work in isolation. In most cases, a project relies on reusable functionality in the form of libraries or is broken up into individual components to compose a modularized system. Dependency management is a technique for declaring, resolving and using dependencies required by the project in an automated fashion.

== Dependency management in Gradle

Gradle has built-in support for dependency management and lives up the task of fulfilling typical scenarios encountered in modern software projects.
We’ll explore the main concepts with the help of an example project.
The illustration below should give you an rough overview on all the moving parts.

The example project builds Java source code.
Some of the Java source files import classes from link:https://github.com/google/guava[Google Guava], a open-source library providing a wealth of utility functionality.
In addition to Guava, the project needs the link:http://junit.org/junit5/[JUnit] libraries for compiling and executing test code.

Guava and JUnit represent the _dependencies_ of this project.
A build script developer can <<sec:declaring-dependencies,declare dependencies>> for different scopes e.g. just for compilation of source code or for executing tests.
In Gradle, the <<managing_dependency_configurations.adoc#managing_dependency_configurations,scope of a dependency>> is called a _configuration_.
For a full overview, see the reference material on <<dependency_types.adoc#dependency_types,dependency types>>.

Often times dependencies come in the form of <<dependency-management-terminology.adoc#sub:terminology_module,modules>>.
You’ll need to tell Gradle where to find those modules so they can be consumed by the build.
The location for storing modules is called a _repository_.
By <<declaring_repositories.adoc#declaring_repositories,declaring repositories>> for a build, Gradle will know how to find and retrieve modules.
Repositories can come in different forms: as local directory or a remote repository.
The reference on <<repository_types.adoc#repository_types,repository types>> provides a broad coverage on this topic.

At runtime, Gradle will locate the declared dependencies if needed for operating a specific task.
The dependencies might need to be downloaded from a remote repository, retrieved from a local directory or requires another project to be built in a multi-project setting.
This process is called _dependency resolution_.
You can find a detailed discussion in <<#sec:dependency_resolution,How dependency resolution works>>.

Once resolved, the resolution mechanism <<dependency_cache.adoc#dependency_cache,stores the underlying files of a dependency in a local cache>>, also referred to as the _dependency cache_.
Future builds reuse the files stored in the cache to avoid unnecessary network calls.

Modules can provide additional metadata.
Metadata is the data that describes the module in more detail e.g. the coordinates for finding it in a repository, information about the project, or its authors.
As part of the metadata, a module can define that other modules are needed for it to work properly.
For example, the JUnit 5 platform module also requires the platform commons module.
Gradle automatically resolves those additional modules, so called _transitive dependencies_.
If needed, you can <<managing_transitive_dependencies.adoc#managing_transitive_dependencies,customize the behavior the handling of transitive dependencies>> to your project's requirements.

Projects with tens or hundreds of declared dependencies can easily suffer from dependency hell.
Gradle provides sufficient tooling to visualize, navigate and analyze the dependency graph of a project either with the help of a link:https://scans.gradle.com/get-started[build scan] or built-in tasks.
