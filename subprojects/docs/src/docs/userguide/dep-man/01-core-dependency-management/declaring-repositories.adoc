[[sec:declaring-repositories]]
= Declaring repositories

Gradle can resolve dependencies from one or many repositories based on Maven, Ivy or flat directory formats. Check out the <<repository_types.adoc#repository_types,full reference on all types of repositories>> for more information.

[[sec:frequently_used_repositories]]
== Frequently used repositories

Gradle supports the most frequently used Java repositories out of the box.

[[sub:maven_central]]
=== Maven Central repository

Maven Central is a popular repository hosting open source libraries for consumption by Java projects.

To declare the link:https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/[central Maven repository] for your build add this to your script:

.Adding central Maven repository
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=maven-central]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=maven-central]"]
====

[[sub:maven_jcenter]]
=== JCenter Maven repository

http://bintray.com[Bintray]'s JCenter is an up-to-date collection of all popular Maven OSS artifacts, including artifacts published directly to Bintray.

To declare the link:https://jcenter.bintray.com[JCenter Maven repository] add this to your build script:

.Adding Bintray's JCenter Maven repository
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=maven-jcenter]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=maven-jcenter]"]
====

[[sub:maven_google]]
=== Google Maven repository

The Google repository hosts Android-specific artifacts including the Android SDK. For usage examples, see the link:https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies.html#google-maven[relevant documentation].

To declare the link:https://maven.google.com/[Google Maven repository] add this to your build script:

.Adding Google Maven repository
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=maven-google]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=maven-google]"]
====

[[sec:declaring_public_repository]]
== Declaring a publicly-available repository

Organizations building software may want to leverage public binary repositories to download and consume open source dependencies. Popular public repositories include Maven Central, Bintray JCenter and the Google Android repository. Gradle provides built-in shortcut methods for the most widely-used repositories.

.Declaring a repository with the help of shortcut methods
image::dependency-management-shortcut-repositories.png[]

To declare JCenter as repository, add this code to your build script:

.Declaring JCenter repository as source for resolving dependencies
====
include::sample[dir="/userguide/dependencyManagement/declaringRepositories/publicRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=public-repository]"]
include::sample[dir="/userguide/dependencyManagement/declaringRepositories/publicRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=public-repository]"]
====

Under the covers Gradle resolves dependencies from the respective URL of the public repository defined by the shortcut method. All shortcut methods are available via the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.RepositoryHandler.html[RepositoryHandler] API. Alternatively, you can <<#sec:declaring_custom_repository,spell out the URL of the repository>> for more fine-grained control.

[[sec:declaring_custom_repository]]
== Declaring a custom repository by URL

Most enterprise projects set up a binary repository available only within an intranet. In-house repositories enable teams to publish internal binaries, setup user management and security measure and ensure uptime and availability. Specifying a custom URL is also helpful if you want to declare a less popular, but publicly-available repository.

Add the following code to declare an in-house repository for your build reachable through a custom URL.

.Declaring a custom repository by URL
====
include::sample[dir="/userguide/dependencyManagement/declaringRepositories/customRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=custom-repository]"]
include::sample[dir="/userguide/dependencyManagement/declaringRepositories/customRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=custom-repository]"]
====

Repositories with custom URLs can be specified as Maven or Ivy repositories by calling the corresponding methods available on the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.RepositoryHandler.html[RepositoryHandler] API. Gradle supports other protocols than `http` or `https` as part of the custom URL e.g. `file`, `sftp` or `s3`. For a full coverage see the <<repository_types.adoc#sub:supported_transport_protocols,reference manual on supported transport protocols>>.

You can also <<repository_types.adoc#sec:defining_custom_pattern_layout_for_an_ivy_repository,define your own repository layout>> by using `ivy { }` repositories as they are very flexible in terms of how modules are organised in a repository.

[[sec:declaring_multiple_repositories]]
== Declaring multiple repositories

You can define more than one repository for resolving dependencies. Declaring multiple repositories is helpful if some dependencies are only available in one repository but not the other. You can mix any type of repository described in the <<repository_types.adoc#repository_types,reference section>>.

This example demonstrates how to declare various shortcut and custom URL repositories for a project:

.Declaring multiple repositories
====
include::sample[dir="/userguide/dependencyManagement/declaringRepositories/multipleRepositories/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=multiple-repositories]"]
include::sample[dir="/userguide/dependencyManagement/declaringRepositories/multipleRepositories/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=multiple-repositories]"]
====

[NOTE]
====
The order of declaration determines how Gradle will check for dependencies at runtime. If Gradle finds a module descriptor in a particular repository, it will attempt to download all of the artifacts for that module from _the same repository_. You can learn more about the inner workings of <<introduction_dependency_management.adoc#sec:dependency_resolution,Gradle's resolution mechanism>>.
====

[[supported-repo-types]]
== Supported repository types

Gradle is very flexible with the different kinds of repositories it supports.
You may resolve dependencies from:

- a <<sub:maven_repo,Maven compatible>> artifact repository (e.g: Maven Central, JCenter, ...)
- an <<sec:ivy_repositories,Ivy compatible>> artifact repository (including custom layouts)
- <<sec:flat_dir_resolver,local (flat) directories>>
- <<sec:accessing_password_protected_ivy_repositories, authenticated repositories>>
- a wide variety of <<sec:supported_transport_protocols,remote protocols>> such as HTTPS, SFTP, AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage

[[sec:flat_dir_resolver]]
=== Flat directory repository

Some projects might prefer to store dependencies on a shared drive or as part of the project source code instead of a binary repository product. If you want to use a (flat) filesystem directory as a repository, simply type:

.Flat repository resolver
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=flat-dir-multi]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=flat-dir-multi]"]
====

This adds repositories which look into one or more directories for finding dependencies. Note that this type of repository does not support any meta-data formats like Ivy XML or Maven POM files. Instead, Gradle will dynamically generate a module descriptor (without any dependency information) based on the presence of artifacts. However, as Gradle prefers to use modules whose descriptor has been created from real meta-data rather than being generated, flat directory repositories cannot be used to override artifacts with real meta-data from other repositories. For example, if Gradle finds only `jmxri-1.2.1.jar` in a flat directory repository, but `jmxri-1.2.1.pom` in another repository that supports meta-data, it will use the second repository to provide the module.

For the use case of overriding remote artifacts with local ones consider using an Ivy or Maven repository instead whose URL points to a local directory. If you only work with flat directory repositories you don't need to set all attributes of a dependency.

[[sub:maven_local]]
== Local Maven repository

Gradle can consume dependencies available in the link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html[local Maven repository]. Declaring this repository is beneficial for teams that publish to the local Maven repository with one project and consume the artifacts by Gradle in another project.

[NOTE]
====
Gradle stores resolved dependencies in <<dependency_cache.adoc#dependency_cache,its own cache>>. A build does not need to declare the local Maven repository even if you resolve dependencies from a Maven-based, remote repository.
====

Before adding Maven local as a repository, you should <<sec:case-for-maven-local, make sure this is really required>>.

To declare the local Maven cache as a repository add this to your build script:

.Adding the local Maven cache as a repository
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=maven-local]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=maven-local]"]
====

Gradle uses the same logic as Maven to identify the location of your local Maven cache. If a local repository location is defined in a `settings.xml`, this location will be used. The `settings.xml` in `__USER_HOME__/.m2` takes precedence over the `settings.xml` in `__M2_HOME__/conf`. If no `settings.xml` is available, Gradle uses the default location `__USER_HOME__/.m2/repository`.

[[sub:maven_repo]]
== Custom Maven repositories

Many organizations host dependencies in an in-house Maven repository only accessible within the company's network. Gradle can declare Maven repositories by URL.

For adding a custom Maven repository you can do:

.Adding custom Maven repository
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=maven-like-repo]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=maven-like-repo]"]
====

Sometimes a repository will have the POMs published to one location, and the JARs and other artifacts published at another location. To define such a repository, you can do:

.Adding additional Maven repositories for JAR files
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=maven-like-repo-with-jar-repo]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=maven-like-repo-with-jar-repo]"]
====

Gradle will look at the first URL for the POM and the JAR. If the JAR can't be found there, the artifact URLs are used to look for JARs.

See <<sub:authentication_schemes>> for authentication options.

[[sec:ivy_repositories]]
== Custom Ivy repositories

Organizations might decide to host dependencies in an in-house Ivy repository. Gradle can declare Ivy repositories by URL.

[[sec:defining_an_ivy_repository_with_a_standard_layout]]
=== Defining an Ivy repository with a standard layout

To declare an Ivy repository using the standard layout no additional customization is needed. You just declare the URL.

.Ivy repository
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=ivy-repo]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=ivy-repo]"]
====

[[sec:defining_a_named_layout_for_an_ivy_repository]]
=== Defining a named layout for an Ivy repository

You can specify that your repository conforms to the Ivy or Maven default layout by using a named layout.

.Ivy repository with named layout
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=ivy-repo-with-maven-layout]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=ivy-repo-with-maven-layout]"]
====

Valid named layout values are `'gradle'` (the default), `'maven'`, `'ivy'` and `'pattern'`. See link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.repositories.IvyArtifactRepository.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.repositories.IvyArtifactRepository:layout(java.lang.String,%20groovy.lang.Closure)[IvyArtifactRepository.layout(java.lang.String, groovy.lang.Closure)] in the API documentation for details of these named layouts.

[[sec:defining_custom_pattern_layout_for_an_ivy_repository]]
=== Defining custom pattern layout for an Ivy repository

To define an Ivy repository with a non-standard layout, you can define a `'pattern'` layout for the repository:

.Ivy repository with pattern layout
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=ivy-repo-with-pattern-layout]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=ivy-repo-with-pattern-layout]"]
====

To define an Ivy repository which fetches Ivy files and artifacts from different locations, you can define separate patterns to use to locate the Ivy files and artifacts:

Each `artifact` or `ivy` specified for a repository adds an _additional_ pattern to use. The patterns are used in the order that they are defined.

.Ivy repository with multiple custom patterns
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=ivy-repo-with-custom-pattern]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=ivy-repo-with-custom-pattern]"]
====

Optionally, a repository with pattern layout can have its `'organisation'` part laid out in Maven style, with forward slashes replacing dots as separators. For example, the organisation `my.company` would then be represented as `my/company`.

.Ivy repository with Maven compatible layout
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=ivy-repo-with-m2compatible-layout]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=ivy-repo-with-m2compatible-layout]"]
====

[[sec:accessing_password_protected_ivy_repositories]]
=== Accessing password-protected Ivy repositories

You can specify credentials for Ivy repositories secured by basic authentication.

.Ivy repository with authentication
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=authenticated-ivy-repo]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=authenticated-ivy-repo]"]
====

[[how-gradle-downloads-deps]]
== How Gradle downloads dependencies

Gradle takes your dependency declarations and repository definitions and attempts to download all of your dependencies by a process called _dependency resolution_. Below is a brief outline of how this process works.

* Given a required dependency, Gradle attempts to resolve the dependency by searching for the module the dependency points at. Each repository is inspected in order. Depending on the type of repository, Gradle looks for metadata files describing the module (`.module`, `.pom` or `ivy.xml` file) or directly for artifact files.

** If the dependency is declared as a dynamic version (like `1.+`, `[1.0,)`, `[1.0, 2.0)`), Gradle will resolve this to the highest available concrete version (like `1.2`) in the repository. For Maven repositories, this is done using the `maven-metadata.xml` file, while for Ivy repositories this is done by directory listing.

** If the module metadata is a POM file that has a parent POM declared, Gradle will recursively attempt to resolve each of the parent modules for the POM.

* Once each repository has been inspected for the module, Gradle will choose the 'best' one to use. This is done using the following criteria:

** For a dynamic version, a 'higher' concrete version is preferred over a 'lower' version.

** Modules declared by a module metadata file (`.module`, `.pom` or `ivy.xml` file) are preferred over modules that have an artifact file only.

** Modules from earlier repositories are preferred over modules in later repositories.

** When the dependency is declared by a concrete version and a module metadata file is found in a repository, there is no need to continue searching later repositories and the remainder of the process is short-circuited.

* All of the artifacts for the module are then requested from the _same repository_ that was chosen in the process above.

The dependency resolution process is highly customizable to meet enterprise requirements. For more information, see the chapter on <<customizing_dependency_resolution_behavior.adoc#customizing_dependency_resolution_behavior,customizing dependency resolution>>.

[[sub:http-retries]]
=== HTTP Retries

Gradle will make several attempts to connect to a given repository. If it fails, Gradle will retry, increasing the amount of time waiting between each retry. After a max number of failed attempts, the repository will be blacklisted for the whole build.


[[sec:case-for-maven-local]]
== The case for mavenLocal()

As a general advice, you should avoid adding `mavenLocal()` as a repository.
There are different issues with using `mavenLocal()` that you should be aware of:

* as it is a local repository, it can't be trusted, which means that
 ** origin of artifacts cannot be tracked, which is a security problem
 ** artifacts can be easily overwritten, which is a both a security and a reproducibility problem
* to mitigate the fact metadata artifacts can be changed, Gradle currently does not cache any metadata from local repositories
** as a consequence, your builds are slower
** given that order of repositories is important, adding `mavenLocal()` _first_ means that all your builds are going to be slower

There are a few cases where you might, legitimately, want to use `mavenLocal()`:

* for interoperability with Maven
** for example, project A is built with Maven, project B is built with Gradle, and you need to share the artifacts during development
** it is _always_ preferable to use a local repository server instead
** in case this is not possible, you should limit this to _local builds only_
* for interoperability with Gradle itself
** in a multi-repository world, you want to check that changes to project A work with project B
** it is preferable to use <<composite-builds#composite-builds.adoc, composite builds>> for this use case
** if for some reason composite builds are not applicable, you can add `mavenLocal()`

[[sub:supported_transport_protocols]]
== Supported repository transport protocols

Maven and Ivy repositories support the use of various transport protocols. At the moment the following protocols are supported:

.Repository transport protocols
[%header%autowidth,compact]
|===
| Type | Credential types

| `file`
| none

| `http`
| username/password

| `https`
| username/password

| `sftp`
| username/password

| `s3`
| access key/secret key/session token or Environment variables

| `gcs`
| https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials[default application credentials] sourced from well known files, Environment variables etc.
|===

[NOTE]
====
Username and password should never be checked in plain text into version control as part of your build file. You can store the credentials in a local `gradle.properties` file and use one of the open source Gradle plugins for encrypting and consuming credentials e.g. the link:https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/nu.studer.credentials[credentials plugin].
====

The transport protocol is part of the URL definition for a repository. The following build script demonstrates how to create a HTTP-based Maven and Ivy repository:

.Declaring a Maven and Ivy repository
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=maven-ivy-repository-no-auth]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=maven-ivy-repository-no-auth]"]
====

The following example shows how to declare SFTP repositories:

.Using the SFTP protocol for a repository
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=maven-ivy-repository-auth]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=maven-ivy-repository-auth]"]
====

When using an AWS S3 backed repository you need to authenticate using link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.credentials.AwsCredentials.html[AwsCredentials], providing access-key and a private-key. The following example shows how to declare a S3 backed repository and providing AWS credentials:

.Declaring a S3 backed Maven and Ivy repository
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=maven-ivy-s3-repository]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=maven-ivy-s3-repository]"]
====

You can also delegate all credentials to the AWS sdk by using the AwsImAuthentication. The following example shows how:

.Declaring a S3 backed Maven and Ivy repository using IAM
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=maven-ivy-s3-repository-with-iam]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=maven-ivy-s3-repository-with-iam]"]
====

When using a Google Cloud Storage backed repository default application credentials will be used with no further configuration required:

.Declaring a Google Cloud Storage backed Maven and Ivy repository using default application credentials
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=maven-ivy-gcs-repository]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=maven-ivy-gcs-repository]"]
====

[[sub:s3_configuration_properties]]
=== S3 configuration properties

The following system properties can be used to configure the interactions with s3 repositories:

`org.gradle.s3.endpoint`::
Used to override the AWS S3 endpoint when using a non AWS, S3 API compatible, storage service.

`org.gradle.s3.maxErrorRetry`::
Specifies the maximum number of times to retry a request in the event that the S3 server responds with a HTTP 5xx status code. When not specified a default value of 3 is used.

[[sub:s3_url_formats]]
=== S3 URL formats

S3 URL's are 'virtual-hosted-style' and must be in the following format

----
s3://<bucketName>[.<regionSpecificEndpoint>]/<s3Key>
----

e.g. `s3://myBucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/maven/release`

* `myBucket` is the AWS S3 bucket name.
* `s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com` is the _optional_ http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region[region specific endpoint].
* `/maven/release` is the AWS S3 key (unique identifier for an object within a bucket)


[[sub:s3_proxy_settings]]
=== S3 proxy settings

A proxy for S3 can be configured using the following system properties:

* `https.proxyHost`
* `https.proxyPort`
* `https.proxyUser`
* `https.proxyPassword`
* `http.nonProxyHosts`

If the 'org.gradle.s3.endpoint' property has been specified with a http (not https) URI the following system proxy settings can be used:

* `http.proxyHost`
* `http.proxyPort`
* `http.proxyUser`
* `http.proxyPassword`
* `http.nonProxyHosts`

[[s3_v4_signatures]]
=== AWS S3 V4 Signatures (AWS4-HMAC-SHA256)

Some of the AWS S3 regions (eu-central-1 - Frankfurt) require that all HTTP requests are signed in accordance with AWS's http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html[signature version 4]. It is recommended to specify S3 URL's containing the region specific endpoint when using buckets that require V4 signatures. e.g.

----
s3://somebucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/maven/release
----

[NOTE]
====
When a region-specific endpoint is not specified for buckets requiring V4 Signatures, Gradle will use the default AWS region (us-east-1) and the
following warning will appear on the console:

Attempting to re-send the request to .... with AWS V4 authentication. To avoid this warning in the future, use region-specific endpoint to access buckets located in regions that require V4 signing.

Failing to specify the region-specific endpoint for buckets requiring V4 signatures means:

* `3 round-trips to AWS, as opposed to one, for every file upload and download.`
* `Depending on location - increased network latencies and slower builds.`
* `Increased likelihood of transmission failures.`
====

[[sub:s3_cross_account]]
==== AWS S3 Cross Account Access

Some organizations may have multiple AWS accounts, e.g. one for each team. The AWS account of the bucket owner is often different from the artifact publisher and consumers. The bucket owner needs to be able to grant the consumers access otherwise the artifacts will only be usable by the publisher's account. This is done by adding the `bucket-owner-full-control` link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl[Canned ACL] to the uploaded objects. Gradle will do this in every upload. Make sure the publisher has the required IAM permission, `PutObjectAcl` (and `PutObjectVersionAcl` if bucket versioning is enabled), either directly or via an assumed IAM Role (depending on your case). You can read more at link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-access-control.html[AWS S3 Access Permissions].

[[sub:gcs_configuration_properties]]
=== Google Cloud Storage configuration properties

The following system properties can be used to configure the interactions with link:https://cloud.google.com/storage/[Google Cloud Storage] repositories:

`org.gradle.gcs.endpoint`::
Used to override the Google Cloud Storage endpoint when using a non-Google Cloud Platform, Google Cloud Storage API compatible, storage service.

`org.gradle.gcs.servicePath`::
Used to override the Google Cloud Storage root service path which the Google Cloud Storage client builds requests from, defaults to `/`.

[[sub:gcs_url_formats]]
=== Google Cloud Storage URL formats

Google Cloud Storage URL's are 'virtual-hosted-style' and must be in the following format `gcs://&lt;bucketName&gt;/&lt;objectKey&gt;`

e.g. `gcs://myBucket/maven/release`

* `myBucket` is the Google Cloud Storage bucket name.
* `/maven/release` is the Google Cloud Storage key (unique identifier for an object within a bucket)

[[sub:authentication_schemes]]
=== Configuring HTTP authentication schemes

When configuring a repository using HTTP or HTTPS transport protocols, multiple authentication schemes are available. By default, Gradle will attempt to use all schemes that are supported by the Apache HttpClient library, http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/tutorial/html/authentication.html#d5e625[documented here]. In some cases, it may be preferable to explicitly specify which authentication schemes should be used when exchanging credentials with a remote server. When explicitly declared, only those schemes are used when authenticating to a remote repository.

You can specify credentials for Maven repositories secured by basic authentication using api:org.gradle.api.credentials.PasswordCredentials[].

.Accessing password-protected Maven repository
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=authenticated-maven-repo]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=authenticated-maven-repo]"]
====

NOTE: The code for this example can be found at **`samples/userguide/artifacts/defineRepository`** in the ‘-all’ distribution of Gradle.

The following example show how to configure a repository to use only api:org.gradle.authentication.http.DigestAuthentication[]:

.Configure repository to use only digest authentication
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=digest-authentication]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=digest-authentication]"]
====

Currently supported authentication schemes are:

link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/authentication/http/BasicAuthentication.html[BasicAuthentication]::
Basic access authentication over HTTP. When using this scheme, credentials are sent preemptively.

link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/authentication/http/DigestAuthentication.html[DigestAuthentication]::
Digest access authentication over HTTP.

link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/authentication/http/HttpHeaderAuthentication.html[HttpHeaderAuthentication]::
Authentication based on any custom HTTP header, e.g. private tokens, OAuth tokens, etc.

[[sub:preemptive_authentication]]
=== Using preemptive authentication

Gradle's default behavior is to only submit credentials when a server responds with an authentication challenge in the form of a HTTP 401 response. In some cases, the server will respond with a different code (ex. for repositories hosted on GitHub a 404 is returned) causing dependency resolution to fail. To get around this behavior, credentials may be sent to the server preemptively. To enable preemptive authentication simply configure your repository to explicitly use the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/authentication/http/BasicAuthentication.html[BasicAuthentication] scheme:

.Configure repository to use preemptive authentication
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=preemptive-authentication]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=preemptive-authentication]"]
====

=== Using HTTP header authentication

You can specify any HTTP header for secured Maven repositories requiring token, OAuth2 or other HTTP header based authentication using api:org.gradle.api.credentials.HttpHeaderCredentials[] with api:org.gradle.authentication.http.HttpHeaderAuthentication[].

.Accessing header-protected Maven repository
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=header-authenticated-maven-repo]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/artifacts/defineRepository/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=header-authenticated-maven-repo]"]
====

NOTE: The code for this example can be found at **`samples/userguide/artifacts/defineRepository`** in the ‘-all’ distribution of Gradle.


[[plugin-vs-build-repos]]
== Plugin repositories vs. build repositories

TODO

[[dependency_cache]]
== The Dependency Cache

Gradle contains a highly sophisticated dependency caching mechanism, which seeks to minimise the number of remote requests made in dependency resolution, while striving to guarantee that the results of dependency resolution are correct and reproducible.

The Gradle dependency cache consists of two storage types located under `GRADLE_USER_HOME/caches`:

* A file-based store of downloaded artifacts, including binaries like jars as well as raw downloaded meta-data like POM files and Ivy files. The storage path for a downloaded artifact includes the SHA1 checksum, meaning that 2 artifacts with the same name but different content can easily be cached.
* A binary store of resolved module meta-data, including the results of resolving dynamic versions, module descriptors, and artifacts.

The Gradle cache does not allow the local cache to hide problems and create other mysterious and difficult to debug behavior.
Gradle enables reliable and reproducible enterprise builds with a focus on bandwidth and storage efficiency.

[[sub:cache_metadata]]
=== Separate metadata cache

Gradle keeps a record of various aspects of dependency resolution in binary format in the metadata cache.
The information stored in the metadata cache includes:

* The result of resolving a dynamic version (e.g. `1.+`) to a concrete version (e.g. `1.2`).
* The resolved module metadata for a particular module, including module artifacts and module dependencies.
* The resolved artifact metadata for a particular artifact, including a pointer to the downloaded artifact file.
* The _absence_ of a particular module or artifact in a particular repository, eliminating repeated attempts to access a resource that does not exist.

Every entry in the metadata cache includes a record of the repository that provided the information as well as a timestamp that can be used for cache expiry.

[[sub:cache_repository_independence]]
=== Repository caches are independent

As described above, for each repository there is a separate metadata cache.
A repository is identified by its URL, type and layout.
If a module or artifact has not been previously resolved from _this repository_, Gradle will attempt to resolve the module against the repository.
This will always involve a remote lookup on the repository, however in many cases <<#sub:cache_artifact_reuse,no download will be required>>.

Dependency resolution will fail if the required artifacts are not available in any repository specified by the build, even if the local cache has a copy of this artifact which was retrieved from a different repository.
Repository independence allows builds to be isolated from each other in an advanced way that no build tool has done before.
This is a key feature to create builds that are reliable and reproducible in any environment.

[[sub:cache_artifact_reuse]]
=== Artifact reuse

Before downloading an artifact, Gradle tries to determine the checksum of the required artifact by downloading the sha file associated with that artifact.
If the checksum can be retrieved, an artifact is not downloaded if an artifact already exists with the same id and checksum.
If the checksum cannot be retrieved from the remote server, the artifact will be downloaded (and ignored if it matches an existing artifact).

As well as considering artifacts downloaded from a different repository, Gradle will also attempt to reuse artifacts found in the local Maven Repository.
If a candidate artifact has been downloaded by Maven, Gradle will use this artifact if it can be verified to match the checksum declared by the remote server.

[[sub:cache_checksum_storage]]
=== Checksum based storage

It is possible for different repositories to provide a different binary artifact in response to the same artifact identifier.
This is often the case with Maven SNAPSHOT artifacts, but can also be true for any artifact which is republished without changing its identifier.
By caching artifacts based on their SHA1 checksum, Gradle is able to maintain multiple versions of the same artifact.
This means that when resolving against one repository Gradle will never overwrite the cached artifact file from a different repository.
This is done without requiring a separate artifact file store per repository.

[[sub:cache_locking]]
=== Cache Locking

The Gradle dependency cache uses file-based locking to ensure that it can safely be used by multiple Gradle processes concurrently.
The lock is held whenever the binary meta-data store is being read or written, but is released for slow operations such as downloading remote artifacts.

[[sub:cache_cleanup]]
==== Cache Cleanup

Gradle keeps track of which artifacts in the dependency cache are accessed.
Using this information, the cache is periodically (at most every 24 hours) scanned for artifacts that have not been used for more than 30 days.
Obsolete artifacts are then deleted to ensure the cache does not grow indefinitely.
