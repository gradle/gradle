[[sub::declaring_without_version]]
== Declaring a dependency without version

A recommended practice for larger projects is to declare dependencies without versions and use <<managing_transitive_dependencies.adoc#sec:dependency_constraints,dependency constraints>> for version declaration. The advantage is that dependency constraints allow you to manage versions of all dependencies, including transitive ones, in one place.

== Dealing with versions which change over time

[[sub:declaring_dependency_with_dynamic_version]]
=== Declaring a dynamic version

Projects might adopt a more aggressive approach for consuming dependencies to modules.
For example you might want to always integrate the latest version of a dependency to consume cutting edge features at any given time.
A _dynamic version_ allows for resolving the latest version or the latest version of a version range for a given module.

[NOTE]
====
Using dynamic versions in a build bears the risk of potentially breaking it. As soon as a new version of the dependency is released that contains an incompatible API change your source code might stop compiling.

A link:https://scans.gradle.com/[build scan] can effectively visualize dynamic dependency versions and their respective, selected versions.

By default, Gradle caches dynamic versions of dependencies for 24 hours. Within this time frame, Gradle does not try to resolve newer versions from the declared repositories.
The <<troubleshooting_dependency_resolution.adoc#sub:dynamic_versions_and_changing_modules,threshold can be configured>> as needed for example if you want to resolve new versions earlier.

[[sub:declaring_dependency_with_changing_version]]
=== Declaring a changing version

A team might decide to implement a series of features before releasing a new version of the application or library. A common strategy to allow consumers to integrate an unfinished version of their artifacts early and often is to release a module with a so-called _changing version_.
A changing version indicates that the feature set is still under active development and hasn't released a stable version for general availability yet.

In Maven repositories, changing versions are commonly referred to as link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#What_is_a_SNAPSHOT_version[snapshot versions].
Snapshot versions contain the suffix `-SNAPSHOT`.
The following example demonstrates how to declare a snapshot version on the Spring dependency.

By default, Gradle caches changing versions of dependencies for 24 hours.
Within this time frame, Gradle does not try to resolve newer versions from the declared repositories. The <<troubleshooting_dependency_resolution.adoc#sub:dynamic_versions_and_changing_modules,threshold can be configured>> as needed for example if you want to resolve new snapshot versions earlier.

Gradle is flexible enough to treat any version as changing version e.g. if you wanted to model snapshot behavior for an Ivy module.
All you need to do is to set the property link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/ExternalModuleDependency.html#setChanging-boolean-[ExternalModuleDependency.setChanging(boolean)] to `true`.
