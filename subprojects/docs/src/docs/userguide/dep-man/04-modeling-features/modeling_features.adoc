[[modeling-features]]
= Modeling features and their dependencies

[[declaring-component-capabilities]]
== Declaring component capabilities

=== Capabilities as first-level concept

Components provide a number of features which are often orthogonal to the software architecture used to provide those features.
For example, a library may include several features in a single artifact.
However, such a library would be published at single GAV (group, artifact and version) coordinates.
This means that, at single coordinates, potentially co-exist different "features" of a component.

With Gradle it becomes interesting to explicitly declare what features a component provides.
For this, Gradle provides the concept of <<controlling_transitive_dependencies.adoc#sec:capabilities,capability>>.

A feature is often built by combining different _capabilities_.

In an ideal world, components shouldn't declare dependencies on explicit GAVs, but rather express their requirements in terms of capabilities:

- "give me a component which provides logging"
- "give me a scripting engine"
- "give me a scripting engine that supports Groovy"

By modeling _capabilities_, the dependency management engine can be smarter and tell you whenever you have _incompatible capabilities_ in a dependency graph, or ask you to choose whenever different modules in a graph provide the same _capability_.

=== Declaring capabilities for external modules

It's worth noting that Gradle supports declaring capabilities for components you build, but also for external components in case they didn't.

For example, if your build file contains the following dependencies:

.A build file with an implicit conflict of logging frameworks
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies/declaringCapabilities/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=dependencies]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies/declaringCapabilities/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=dependencies]"]
====

As is, it's pretty hard to figure out that you will end up with two logging frameworks on the classpath.
In fact, `zookeeper` will bring in `log4j`, where what we want to use is `log4j-over-slf4j`.
We can preemptively detect the conflict by adding a rule which will declare that both logging frameworks provide the same capability:

.A build file with an implicit conflict of logging frameworks
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies/declaringCapabilities/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=declare_capability]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies/declaringCapabilities/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=declare_capability]"]
====

By adding this rule, we will make sure that Gradle _will_ detect conflicts and properly fail:

```
Cannot choose between log4j:log4j:1.2.16 and org.slf4j:log4j-over-slf4j:1.7.10 because they provide the same capability: org.slf4j:slf4j-capability:1.0
```

See the <<controlling_transitive_dependencies.adoc#sec:capabilities, capabilities section of the documentation>> to figure out how to fix capability conflicts.

=== Declaring additional capabilities for a local component

All components have an _implicit capability_ corresponding to the same GAV coordinates as the component.
This is convenient whenever a library published at different GAV coordinates is an _alternate implementation_ of the same API.
However, it is also possible to declare additional _explicit capabilities_ for a component:

.Declaring capabilities of a component
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/outgoingCapabilities/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=declare-outgoing-capabilities]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/outgoingCapabilities/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=declare-outgoing-capabilities]"]
====

Capabilities must be attached to _outgoing configurations_, which are <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sub:resolvable-consumable-configs,consumable configurations>> of a component.

This example shows that we declare two capabilities:

1. `com.acme:my-library:1.0`, which corresponds to the _implicit capability_ of the library
2. `com.other:module:1.1`, which corresponds to another capability of this library

It's worth noting we need to do 1. because as soon as you start declaring _explicit_ capabilities, then _all_ capabilities need to be declared, including the _implicit_ one.

The second capability can be specific to this library, or it can correspond to a capability provided by an external component.
In that case, if `com.other:module` appears in the same dependency graph, the build will fail and consumers <<controlling_transitive_dependencies.adoc#selecting-between-candidates,will have to choose what module to use>>.

Capabilities are published to Gradle Module Metadata.
However, they have _no equivalent_ in POM or Ivy metadata files.
As a consequence, when publishing such a component, Gradle will warn you that this feature is only for Gradle consumers:

```
Maven publication 'maven' contains dependencies that cannot be represented in a published pom file.
  - Declares capability com.acme:my-library:1.0
  - Declares capability com.other:module:1.1
```

include::feature_variants.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[[understanding-variant-selection]]
== Understanding variant selection

Gradle's dependency management engine is known as _variant aware_.
In a traditional dependency management engine like Apache Maven™, dependencies are bound to components published at GAV coordinates.
This means that the set of transitive dependencies for a component is solely determined by the GAV coordinates of this component.
It doesn't matter what _artifact_ is actually resolved, the set of dependencies is _always the same_.
In addition, selecting a different artifact for a component (for example, using the `jdk7` artifact) is cumbersome as it requires the use of _classifiers_.
One issue with this model is that it cannot guarantee global graph consistency because there are no common semantics associated with _classifiers_.
What this means is that there's nothing which prevents from having both the `jdk7` and `jdk8` versions of a single module on classpath, because the engine has no idea what semantics are associated with the classifier name.

.The Maven component model
image::component-model-maven.png[]

Gradle, in addition to the concept of a _module_ published at GAV coordinates, introduces the concept of _variants_ of this module.
Variants correspond to the different "views" of a component that is published at the same GAV coordinates.
In the Gradle model, artifacts are attached to _variants_, not modules.
This means, in practice, that different _artifacts_ can have a different set of dependencies:

.The Gradle component model
image::component-model-gradle.png[]

This intermediate level, which associates artifacts and dependencies to variants instead of directly to the component, allows Gradle to model properly what each artifact is used for.

However, this raises the question about how variants are selected: how does Gradle know which variant to choose when there's more than one?
In practice, variants are selected thanks to the use of <<variant_aware_plugins.adoc#sec:abm_declaring_attributes,attributes>>, which provide semantics to the variants and help the engine in achieving a _consistent resolution result_.

For historical reasons, Gradle differentiates between two kind of components:

- local components, built from sources, for which <<#sec:abm_configuration_attributes, variants are mapped to outgoing configurations>>
- external components, published on repositories, in which case either the module was published with Gradle Module Metadata and variants are natively supported, or the module is using Ivy/Maven metadata and <<#mapping-maven-ivy-to-variants,variants are derived from metadata>>.

In both cases, Gradle performs _variant aware selection_.

[[sec:abm_configuration_attributes]]
== Configuration and variant attributes

Local components expose variants as _outgoing configurations_, which are <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sub:resolvable-consumable-configs,consumable configurations>>.
When dependency resolution happens, the engine will select one variant of an outgoing component by selecting one of its _consumable configurations).

[NOTE]
====
There are 2 noticeable exception to this rule:

- whenever a producer does _not_ expose any consumable configuration
- whenever the consumer _explicitly selects a target configuration_

In this case, _variant aware resolution is bypassed_.
====

Attributes are used on both _resolvable configurations_ (also known as a _consumer_) and _consumable configurations_ (on the _producer_).
Adding attributes to other kinds of configurations doesn't have sense.

The role of the dependency resolution engine is to find a suitable _variant_ of a _producer_ given the constraints expressed by a _consumer_.

This is where attributes come into play: their role is to perform the selection of the right _variant_ of a component.

[NOTE]
.Variants vs configurations
====
For external components, the terminology is to use the word _variants_, not _configurations_. Configurations are a super-set of variants.

This means that an external component provide _variants_, which also have attributes.
However, sometimes the term _configuration_ may leak into the DSL for historical reasons, or because you use Ivy which also has this concept of _configuration_.
====


[[variant-aware-matching]]
=== Variant aware matching

Let's take the example of a `lib` library which exposes 2 variants: its API (via a variant named `exposedApi`) and its runtime (via a variant named `exposedRuntime`).

[NOTE]
.About producer variants
====
The variant _name_ is there mostly for debugging purposes and to get a nicer display in error messages.
The name, in particular, doesn't participate in the _id_ of a variant: only its attributes do.
That is to say that to search for a particular variant, one _must_ rely on its attributes, _not_ its name.

There are no restriction on the number of variants a component can expose.
Traditionally, a component would expose an API and an implementation, but we may, for example, want to expose the test fixtures of a component too.
It is also possible to expose _different APIs_ for different consumers (think about different environments, like Linux vs Windows).
====

A consumer needs to explain _what_ variant it needs and this is done by setting _attributes_ on the _consumer_.

Attributes consist of a _name_ and a _value_ pair.
For example, Gradle comes with a standard attribute named `org.gradle.usage` specifically to deal with the concept of selecting the right variant of a component based on the usage of the consumer (compile, runtime ...).
It is however possible to define an arbitrary number of attributes.
As a producer, we can express that a consumable configuration represents the API of a component by attaching the `(org.gradle.usage,JAVA_API)` attribute to the variant.
As a consumer, we can express that we need the API of the dependencies of a resolvable configuration by attaching the `(org.gradle.usage,JAVA_API)` attribute to it.
Doing this, Gradle has a way to _automatically select the appropriate variant_ by looking at the configuration attributes:

- the consumer wants `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_API`
- the producer, `lib` exposes 2 different variants. One with `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_API`, the other with `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_RUNTIME`.
- Gradle chooses the `org.gradle.usage=JAVA_API` variant of the producer because it _matches the consumer attributes_

In other words: attributes are used to perform the selection based on the values of the attributes.

A more elaborate example involves more than one attribute.
Typically, a Java Library project in Gradle will involve 4 different attributes, found both on the producer and consumer sides:

- `org.gradle.usage`, explaining if the variant is the API of a component, or its implementation
- `org.gradle.dependency.bundling`, which declares how the dependencies of the component are bundled (for example, if the artifact is a fat jar, then the bundling is `EMBEDDED`)
- `org.gradle.libraryelements`, which is used to explain what _parts_ of the library the variant contains (classes, resources or everything)
- `org.gradle.jvm.version`, which is used to explain what _minimal version_ of Java this variant is targeted at

Now imagine that our library comes in two different flavors:

- one for JDK 8
- one for JDK 9+

This is typically achieved, in Maven, by producing 2 different artifacts, a "main" artifact and a "classified" one.
However, in Maven a consumer cannot express the fact it needs the _most appropriate_ version of the library based on the runtime.

With Gradle, this is elegantly solved by having the producer declare 2 variants:

- one with `org.gradle.jvm.version=8`, for consumers _at least running on JDK 8_
- one with `org.gradle.jvm.version=9`, for consumers starting from JDK 9

Note that the artifacts for both variants will be different, but their dependencies _may_ be different too.
Typically, the JDK 8 variant may need a "backport" library of JDK 9+ to work, that only consumers running on JDK 8 should get.

On the consumer side, the _resolvable configuration_ will set all four attributes above, and, depending on the runtime, will set its `org.gradle.jvm.version` to 8 or more.

[NOTE]
.A note about compatibility of variants
====
What if the consumer sets `org.gradle.jvm.version` to 7?

Then resolution would _fail_ with an error message explaining that there's no matching variant of the producer.
This is because Gradle recognizes that the consumer wants a Java 7 compatible library, but the _minimal_ version of Java available on the producer is 8.
If, on the other hand, the consumer needs _11_, then Gradle knows both the _8_ and _9_ variant would work, but it will select _9_ because it's the highest compatible version.
====

Details about understanding variant selection errors can be found <<viewing_debugging_dependencies.adoc#sec:resolving-variant-aware-errors,here>>.

[[mapping-maven-ivy-to-variants]]
=== Mapping from Maven/Ivy to variants

Neither Maven nor Ivy have the concept of _variants_, which are only natively supported by Gradle Module Metadata.
However, it doesn't prevent Gradle from working with them thanks to different strategies.

[NOTE]
.Relationship with Gradle Module Metadata
====
Gradle Module Metadata is a metadata format for modules published on Maven, Ivy or other kind of repositories.
It is similar to `pom.xml` or `ivy.xml` files, but this format is _aware of variants_.
This means that if your project produces additional variants, those are available and published as part of the module metadata, which greatly improves the user experience.

See the {metadata-file-spec}[Gradle Module Metadata specification] for more information.
====

[[sec:maven-mapping-to-variants]]
==== Mapping of POM files to variants

Modules published on a Maven repository are converted into variant-aware modules.
A particularity of Maven modules is that there is no way to know what kind of component is published.
In particular, there's no way to make the difference between a BOM representing a _platform_, and a BOM used as a super-POM..
Sometimes, it is even possible for a POM file to act both as a platform _and_ a library.

As a consequence, Maven modules are derived into 6 distinct variants, which allows Gradle users to explain precisely what they depend on:

* 2 "library" variants (attribute `org.gradle.category` = `library`)
** the `compile` variant maps the `<scope>compile</scope>` dependencies.
   This variant is equivalent to the `apiElements` variant of the <<java_library_plugin.adoc#,Java Library plugin>>.
   All dependencies of this scope are considered _API dependencies_.
** the `runtime` variant maps both the `<scope>compile</scope>` and `<scope>runtime</scope>` dependencies.
   This variant is equivalent to the `runtimeElements` variant of the <<java_library_plugin.adoc#,Java Library plugin>>.
   All dependencies of those scopes are considered _runtime dependencies_.
   - in both cases, the `<dependencyManagement>` dependencies are _not converted to constraints_
* 4 "platform" variants derived from the `<dependencyManagement>` block (attribute `org.gradle.category` = `platform`):
** the `platform-compile` variant maps the  `<scope>compile</scope>` dependency management dependencies as _dependency constraints_.
** the `platform-runtime` variant maps both the `<scope>compile</scope>` and `<scope>runtime</scope>` dependency management dependencies as _dependency constraints_.
** the `enforced-platform-compile` is similar to `platform-compile` but all the constraints are _forced_
** the `enforced-platform-runtime` is similar to `platform-runtime` but all the constraints are _forced_

You can understand more about the use of platform and enforced platforms variants by looking at the <<controlling_transitive_dependencies#sec:bom_import, importing BOMs>> section of the manual.
By default, whenever you declare a dependency on a Maven module, Gradle is going to look for the `library` variants.
However, using the `platform` or `enforcedPlatform` keyword, Gradle is now looking for one of the "platform" variants, which allows you to import the constraints from the POM files, instead of the dependencies.

[[sec:ivy-mapping-to-variants]]
=== Mapping of Ivy files to variants

Contrary to <<#sec:maven-mapping-to-variants, Maven>>, there is no derivation strategy implemented for Ivy files.
This means that when you have a dependency on an Ivy module, Gradle does _not_ perform variant aware resolution.
Instead, it uses a legacy "compatibility" mode.

[[cross-project-publications]]
== Sharing artifacts between projects

A common pattern, in multi-project builds, is that one project consumes the artifacts of another project.
In general, the simplest consumption form in the Java ecosystem is that when `A` depends on `B`, then `A` would depend on the `jar` produced by project `B`.
As previously described in this chapter, this is modeled by `A` depending on a _variant of_ `B`, where the variant is selected based on the needs of `A`.
For compilation, we need the API dependencies of `B`, provided by the `apiElements` variant.
For runtime, we need the runtime dependencies of `B`, provided by the `runtimeElements` variant.

However, what if you need a _different_ artifact than the main one?
Gradle provides, for example, built-in support for depending on the <<java_testing.adoc#sec:java_test_fixtures,test fixtures>> of another project, but sometimes the artifact you need to depend on simply isn't exposed as a variant.

In order to be _safe to share_ between projects and allow maximum performance (parallelism), such artifacts must be exposed via _outgoing configurations_.

[WARNING]
.Don't reference other project tasks directly
====
A frequent anti-pattern to declare cross-project dependencies is:

```groovy
dependencies {
   // this is unsafe!
   implementation project(":other").tasks.someOtherJar
}
```

This publication model is _unsafe_ and can lead to non-reproducible and hard to parallelize builds.
This section explains how to _properly create cross-project boundaries_ by defining "exchanges" between projects by using _variants_.
====

There are two, complementary, options to share artifacts between projects.
The <<#sec:simple-sharing-artifacts-between-projects,simplified version>> is only suitable if what you need to share is a simple artifact that doesn't depend on the consumer.
The simple solution is also limited to cases where this artifact is not published to a repository.
This also implies that the consumer does not publish a dependency to this artifact.
In cases where the consumer resolves to different artifacts in different contexts (e.g., different target platforms) or that publication is required, you need to use the <<#sec:variant-aware-sharing,advanced version>>.

[[sec:simple-sharing-artifacts-between-projects]]
=== Simple sharing of artifacts between projects

First, a producer needs to declare a configuration which is going to be _exposed_ to consumers.
As explained in the <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sub:resolvable-consumable-configs, configurations chapter>>, this corresponds to a _consumable configuration_.

Let's imagine that the consumer requires _instrumented classes_ from the producer, but that this artifact is _not_ the main one.
The producer can expose its instrumented classes by creating a configuration that will "carry" this artifact:

.Declaring an outgoing variant
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/simple/groovy",files="producer/build.gradle[tags=declare-outgoing-configuration]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/simple/kotlin",files="producer/build.gradle.kts[tags=declare-outgoing-configuration]"]
====

This configuration is _consumable_, which means it's an "exchange" meant for consumers.
We're now going to add artifacts to this configuration, that consumers would get when they consume it:

.Attaching an artifact to an outgoing configuration
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/simple/groovy",files="producer/build.gradle[tags=attach-outgoing-artifact]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/simple/kotlin",files="producer/build.gradle.kts[tags=attach-outgoing-artifact]"]
====

Here the "artifact" we're attaching is a _task_ that actually generates a Jar.
Doing so, Gradle can automatically track dependencies of this task and build them as needed.
This is possible because the `Jar` task extends `AbstractArchiveTask`.
If it's not the case, you will need to explicitly declare how the artifact is generated.

.Expliciting the task dependency of an artifact
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/simple/groovy",files="producer/build.gradle[tags=attach-outgoing-artifact-explicit]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/simple/kotlin",files="producer/build.gradle.kts[tags=attach-outgoing-artifact-explicit]"]
====

Now the _consumer_ needs to depend on this configuration in order to get the right artifact:

.An explicit configuration dependency
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/simple/groovy",files="consumer/build.gradle[tags=explicit-configuration-dependency]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/simple/kotlin",files="consumer/build.gradle.kts[tags=explicit-configuration-dependency]"]
====

[WARNING]
====
Declaring a dependency on an explicit target configuration is _not recommended_ if you plan to publish the component which has this dependency:
this would likely lead to broken metadata.
If you need to publish the component on a remote repository, follow the instructions of the <<#sec:variant-aware-sharing,variant-aware cross publication documentation>>.
====

In this case, we're adding the dependency to the _instrumentedClasspath_ configuration, which is a _consumer specific configuration_.
In Gradle terminology, this is called a <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sub:resolvable-consumable-configs,resolvable configuration>>, which is defined this way:

.Declaring a resolvable configuration on the consumer
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/simple/groovy",files="consumer/build.gradle[tags=resolvable-configuration]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/simple/kotlin",files="consumer/build.gradle.kts[tags=resolvable-configuration]"]
====

[[sec:variant-aware-sharing]]
=== Variant-aware sharing of artifacts between projects

In the <<#sec:simple-sharing-artifacts-between-projects, simple sharing solution>>, we defined a configuration on the producer side which serves as an exchange of artifacts between the producer and the consumer.
However, the consumer has to explicitly tell which configuration it depends on, which is something we want to avoid in _variant aware resolution_.
In fact, we also <<#understanding-variant-selection, have explained>> that it is possible for a consumer to express requirements using _attributes_ and that the producer should provide the appropriate outgoing variants using attributes too.
This allows for smarter selection, because using a single dependency declaration, without any explicit target configuration, the consumer may resolve different things.
The typical example is that using a single dependency declaration `project(":myLib")`, we would either choose the `arm64` or `i386` version of `myLib` depending on the architecture.

To do this, we will add attributes to both the consumer and the producer.

[WARNING]
====
It is important to understand that once configurations have attributes, they participate in _variant aware resolution_, which means that they are candidates considered whenever _any_ notation like `project(":myLib")` is used.
In other words, the attributes set on the producer _must be consistent with the other variants produced on the same project_.
They must not, in particular, introduce ambiguity for the existing selection.

In practice, it means that the attribute set used on the configuration you create are likely to be dependent on the _ecosystem_ in use (Java, C++, ...) because the relevant plugins for those ecosystems often use different attributes.
====

Let's enhance our previous example which happens to be a Java Library project.
Java libraries expose a couple of variants to their consumers, `apiElements` and `runtimeElements`. Now, we're adding a 3rd one, `instrumentedJars`.

Therefore, we need to understand what our new variant is used for in order to set the proper attributes on it.
Let's look at the attributes we find on the `runtimeElements` configuration:

.gradle outgoingVariants --variant runtimeElements
```
Attributes
    - org.gradle.category            = library
    - org.gradle.dependency.bundling = external
    - org.gradle.jvm.version         = 11
    - org.gradle.libraryelements     = jar
    - org.gradle.usage               = java-runtime
```

What it tells us is that the Java Library plugin produces variants with 5 attributes:

- `org.gradle.category` tells us that this variant represents a _library_
- `org.gradle.dependency.bundling` tells us that the dependencies of this variant are found as jars (they are not, for example, repackaged inside the jar)
- `org.gradle.jvm.version` tells us that the minimum Java version this library supports is Java 11
- `org.gradle.libraryelements` tells us this variant contains all elements found in a jar (classes and resources)
- `org.gradle.usage` says that this variant is a Java runtime, therefore suitable for a Java compiler but also at runtime

As a consequence, if we want our instrumented classes to be used in place of this variant when executing tests, we need to attach similar attributes to our variant.
In fact, the attribute we care about is `org.gradle.libraryelements` which explains _what the variant contains_, so we can setup the variant this way:

.Declaring the variant attributes
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/advanced/groovy",files="producer/build.gradle[tags=declare-outgoing-configuration]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/advanced/kotlin",files="producer/build.gradle.kts[tags=declare-outgoing-configuration]"]
====

[NOTE]
====
Choosing the right attributes to set is the hardest thing in this process, because they carry the semantics of the variant.
Therefore, before adding _new attributes_, you should always ask yourself if there isn't an attribute which carries the semantics you need.
If there isn't, then you may add a new attribute.
When adding new attributes, you must also be careful because it's possible that it creates ambiguity during selection.
Often adding an attribute means adding it to _all_ existing variants.
====

What we have done here is that we have added a _new_ variant, which can be used _at runtime_, but contains instrumented classes instead of the normal classes.
However, it now means that for runtime, the consumer has to choose between two variants:

- `runtimeElements`, the regular variant offered by the `java-library` plugin
- `instrumentedJars`, the variant we have created

In particular, say we want the instrumented classes on the test runtime classpath.
We can now, on the consumer, declare our dependency as a regular project dependency:

.Declaring the project dependency
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/advanced/groovy",files="consumer/build.gradle[tags=test_dependency]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/advanced/kotlin",files="consumer/build.gradle.kts[tags=test_dependency]"]
====

If we stop here, Gradle will still select the `runtimeElements` variant in place of our `instrumentedJars` variant.
This is because the `testRuntimeClasspath` configuration asks for a configuration which `libraryelements` attribute is `jar`, and our new `instrumented-jars` value is _not compatible_.

So we need to change the requested attributes so that we now look for instrumented jars:

.Changing the consumer attributes
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/advanced/groovy",files="consumer/build.gradle[tags=ask-for-instrumented-classes]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/advanced/kotlin",files="consumer/build.gradle.kts[tags=ask-for-instrumented-classes]"]
====

Now, we're telling that whenever we're going to resolve the test runtime classpath, what we are looking for is _instrumented classes_.
There is a problem though: in our dependencies list, we have JUnit, which, obviously, is _not_ instrumented.
So if we stop here, Gradle is going to fail, explaining that there's no variant of JUnit which provide instrumented classes.
This is because we didn't explain that it's fine to use the regular jar, if no instrumented version is available.
To do this, we need to write a _compatibility rule_:

.A compatibility rule
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/advanced/groovy",files="consumer/build.gradle[tags=compatibility-rule]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/advanced/kotlin",files="consumer/build.gradle.kts[tags=compatibility-rule]"]
====

which we need to declare on the attributes schema:

.Making use of the compatibility rule
====
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/advanced/groovy",files="consumer/build.gradle[tags=compatibility-rule-use]"]
include::sample[dir="userguide/dependencyManagement/modelingFeatures/crossProjectPublications/advanced/kotlin",files="consumer/build.gradle.kts[tags=compatibility-rule-use]"]
====

And that's it! Now we have:

- added a variant which provides instrumented jars
- explained that this variant is a substitute for the runtime
- explained that the consumer needs this variant _only for test runtime_

Gradle therefore offers a powerful mechanism to select the right variants based on preferences and compatibility.
More details can be found in the <<variant_aware_plugins.adoc#, variant aware plugins section of the documentation>>.

[WARNING]
====
By adding a value to an existing attribute like we have done, or by defining new attributes, we are extending the model.
This means that _all consumers_ have to know about this extended model.
For local consumers, this is usually not a problem because all projects understand and share the same schema, but if you had to publish this new variant to an external repository, it means that external consumers would have to add the same rules to their builds for them to pass.
This is in general not a problem for _ecosystem plugins_ (e.g: the Kotlin plugin) where consumption is in any case not possible without applying the plugin, but it is a problem if you add custom values or attributes.

So, **avoid publishing custom variants** if they are for internal use only.
====

[[targeting-different-platforms]]
=== Targeting different platforms

It common for a library to target different platforms.
In the Java ecosystem, we often see different artifacts for the same library, distinguished by a different _classifier_.
A typical example is Guava, which is published as this:

- `guava-jre` for JDK 8 and above
- `guava-android` for JDK 7

The problem with this approach is that there's no semantics associated with the classifier.
The dependency resolution engine, in particular, cannot determine automatically which version to use based on the consumer requirements.
For example, it would be better to express that you have a dependency on Guava, and let the engine choose between `jre` and `android` based on what is compatible.

Gradle provides an improved model for this, which doesn't have the weakness of classifiers: attributes.

In particular, in the Java ecosystem, Gradle provides a built-in attribute that library authors can use to express compatibility with the Java ecosystem: `org.gradle.jvm.version`.
This attribute expresses the _minimal version that a consumer must have in order to work properly_.

When you apply the `java` or `java-library` plugins, Gradle will automatically associate this attribute to the outgoing variants.
This means that all libraries published with Gradle automatically tell which target platform they use.

By default, the `org.gradle.jvm.version` is set to the _target compatibility_ of the source set.

While this attribute is automatically set, Gradle _will not_, by default, let you build a project for different JVMs.
If you need to do this, then you will need to create additional variants following the <<#sec:variant-aware-sharing,instructions on variant-aware matching>>.

[NOTE]
Future versions of Gradle will provide ways to automatically build for different Java platforms.
