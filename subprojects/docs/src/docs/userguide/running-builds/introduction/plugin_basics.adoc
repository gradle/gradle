[[plugin_basics]]
= Plugin Basics

Plugins are used to *extend build capability and customize Gradle*.

image::gradle-basic-6.png[]

Most features, like the ability to compile Java code, are added by _plugins_.

Using plugins is also the **primary mechanism for organizing build logic**.

Plugins are essentially a set of all useful tasks, such as compiling tasks, setting domain objects, setting up source files, etc.

Applying a plugin to a project allows the plugin to extend the project's and Gradle's capabilities.

== Plugin distribution

Plugins are distributed in three ways:

1. **Core plugins** - Gradle develops and maintains a set of <<plugin_reference#plugin_reference,Core Plugins>>.
2. **Community plugins** - Gradle's community shares plugins via the https://plugins.gradle.org[Gradle Plugin Portal].
3. **Custom plugins** - Gradle enables user to create custom plugins using link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc.html[APIs].

[[sec:types_of_plugins]]
== Types of plugins

There are two general types of plugins in Gradle, _binary_ plugins and _script_ plugins.

Binary plugins can reside within a build script, within the project hierarchy, or externally in a plugin jar.

Script plugins are additional build scripts that further configure the build and usually implement a declarative approach to manipulating the build.
They are typically used within a build but can be externalized and accessed remotely.

A plugin often starts as a script plugin (because they are easy to write).
Then, as the code becomes more valuable, it becomes a binary plugin that can be easily tested and shared between multiple projects or organizations.

[[sec:using_plugins]]
== Using plugins

To use the build logic encapsulated in a plugin, Gradle needs to perform two steps.

First, it needs to _resolve_ the plugin, and then it needs to _apply_ the plugin to the project.

_Resolving_ a plugin means finding the correct version of the jar that contains a given plugin and adding it to the project.

_Applying_ a plugin means executing the plugin on the project.

[[sec:binary_plugins]]
== Binary plugins

You apply plugins in the build script using their _plugin id_, which is a globally unique identifier or name:

[source]
----
plugins {
    application
    java // Can also be writen id("java")
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm") version "1.9.0"
}
----

Core Gradle plugins are unique in that they provide short names, such as `java` for the core link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/plugins/JavaPlugin.html[JavaPlugin].

All other binary plugins must use the fully qualified form of the plugin id (e.g. `com.github.foo.bar`).

The version should also be called out:

[source]
----
plugins {
    id «plugin id» version «plugin version» [apply «false»]
}
----

== Community plugins

Gradle has a vibrant community of plugin developers who contribute plugins for various capabilities.

The link:http://plugins.gradle.org/[Gradle plugin portal] provides an interface for searching and exploring community plugins.

You could search `generate unit test` in the Gradle Plugin Portal if you wanted to generate unit tests automatically for your project.
There, you will find many plugins, including the link:https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.utbot.gradle.plugin[`ubot` plugin] which you can apply as follows:

[source]
----
plugins {
    id("org.utbot.gradle.plugin") version "1.0.0-alpha"
}
----

== Plugin tasks
Since plugins add tasks to your project when applied, you can view the `utbot` tasks by running:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew tasks

> Task :tasks

------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks runnable from root project 'temp'
------------------------------------------------------------
....
Utbot tasks
-----------
generateTestsAndSarifReport - Generate a SARIF report
....
----

As we can see, the `generateTestsAndSarifReport` has been added to the project.
