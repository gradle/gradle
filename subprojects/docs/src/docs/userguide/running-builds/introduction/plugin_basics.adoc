= Plugin Basics

Plugins are used to *extend build capability and customize Gradle*.

image::gradle-basic-6.png[]

Most features, like the ability to compile Java code, are added by _plugins_.

Using plugins is also the primary mechanism for organizing build logic.

Plugins are essentially a set of useful tasks, such as compiling code, creating documentation, setting up source files, etc.

*Applying* a plugin to a project allows the plugin to extend the project's and Gradle's capabilities.

For example:

- The Spring Boot Gradle Plugin, `org.springframework.boot`, provides Spring Boot support.
- The Google Services Gradle Plugin, `com.google.gms:google-services`, enables Google APIs and Firebase services in your Android application.
- The Palantir Git-Version Plugin, `com.palantir.git-version`, is a plugin that generates a project version for use with Gradle by calling `git-describe`.

== Plugin distribution

Plugins are distributed in three ways:

1. **Core plugins** - Gradle develops and maintains a set of <<plugin_reference#plugin_reference,Core Plugins>>.
2. **Community plugins** - Gradle's community shares plugins via the https://plugins.gradle.org[Gradle Plugin Portal].
3. **Local plugins** - Gradle enables users to create custom plugins using link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc.html[APIs].

You apply plugins in the build script using their *plugin id*, a globally unique identifier, or a name:

[source]
----
plugins {
    id «plugin id» version «plugin version» [apply «false»]
}
----

== Core plugins

Core Gradle plugins are unique in that they provide short names, such as `java` for the core link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/plugins/JavaPlugin.html[JavaPlugin].

To apply the `java` plugin to a project:

[source,build.gradle.kts]
----
plugins {
    java
}
----

The <<java_plugin.adoc#java_plugin,Java plugin>> adds Java compilation along with testing and bundling capabilities to a project.

There are many more <<plugin_reference#plugin_reference,Gradle core plugins>> users can take advantage of.

== Community plugins

Gradle has a vibrant community of plugin developers who contribute plugins for various capabilities, such as the link:https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.springframework.boot[Spring Boot Gradle plugin].

To apply the `org.springframework.boot` plugin to a project:

[source,build.gradle.kts]
----
plugins {
    id("org.springframework.boot") version "3.1.5"
}
----

The Spring Boot plugin provides Spring Boot support in Gradle.
It packages executable JAR or WAR archives and runs link:https://spring.io/[Spring Boot] Java applications.

The link:http://plugins.gradle.org/[Gradle plugin portal] provides an interface for searching and exploring community plugins.

== Plugin tasks

link:https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.google.cloud.tools.jib[Jib] is a Gradle plugin for building Docker and OCI images of Java applications.

The Google Jib Gradle plugin is applied as follows:

[source,build.gradle.kts]
----
plugins {
  id("com.google.cloud.tools.jib") version "3.4.0"
}
----

Since plugins add tasks to your project when applied, you can view the tasks added by the Jib plugin by running `./gradlew tasks`:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew tasks

> Task :tasks

------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks runnable from root project 'plugins'
------------------------------------------------------------

Jib tasks
---------
jib - Builds a container image to a registry.
jibBuildTar - Builds a container image to a tarball.
jibDockerBuild - Builds a container image to a Docker daemon.
----

As we can see, the `jib`, `jibBuildTar`, and `jibDockerBuild` tasks from the Jib plugin have been added to the project and may be executed.
