[[task_basics]]
= Task Basics

The work that Gradle can do on a project is defined by one or more _tasks_.

image::gradle-basic-5.png[]

A task represents some atomic piece of work which a build performs.
This might be compiling some classes, creating a JAR, generating Javadoc, or publishing some archives to a repository.

You run a Gradle build using the `gradle` command or by invoking the Gradle Wrapper (`./gradlew' or `gradle.bat`) in your project directory.
For example:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew build
----

== Available tasks
All available tasks in your project come from Gradle, plugins, and build scrips.

You can list all the available tasks in the project by running the following command in the terminal:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew tasks
----

[source]
----
Application tasks
-----------------
run - Runs this project as a JVM application

Build tasks
-----------
assemble - Assembles the outputs of this project.
build - Assembles and tests this project.

...

Documentation tasks
-------------------
javadoc - Generates Javadoc API documentation for the main source code.

...

Other tasks
-----------
compileJava - Compiles main Java source.

== Hello world task

Let's take a look at a simple "Hello World" task in a build script:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/hello/kotlin", files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/hello/groovy", files="build.gradle[]"]
====

You can execute the build script with `./gradlew -q hello`:

====
----
$ ./gradlew -q hello
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/hello/tests/hello.out[]
----
====

[TIP]
====
The `-q` option suppresses Gradle's log messages, so that only the output of the tasks is shown.
====

In the example, the build script defines a single task, called `hello`, and adds an action to it.

When you run `./gradlew hello`, Gradle executes the `hello` task, which in turn executes the action you've provided.
The action is simply a block containing some code to execute: `println("Hello world!")`.

== Task types

There are two types of tasks:

1. *Actionable tasks* have some action(s) attached to do work in your build: `compileJava`.
2. *Lifecycle tasks* are workflow tasks with no actions attached: `assemble`, `build`.

== Built-in tasks

Gradle provides many _built-in_ tasks that developers can use to enhance build scripts.

This example task copies `*.war` files from the `source` directory to the `target` directory using the `Copy` built-in task.

[source]
----
tasks.register("copyTask",Copy) {
    from("source")
    into("target")
    include("*.war")
}
----

This task is executed using the command `./gradlew :app:copyTask`.

Popular built-in tasks include:

- **Copy** - `Copy` is useful to copy files around.
- **Delete** -  `Delete` is useful to delete files and directories.
- **Exec** - `Exec` is useful to execute arbitrary O/S commands.
- **Zip** - `Zip` is useful to bundle files.

Many more are included in the link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.api.tasks/-delete/index.html[DSL documentation].

== Dependencies between tasks

Many times, a task requires another task to run first.

If `task B` uses the output of `task A`, then `task A` must complete before `task B` begins.

- A task may declare its dependencies explicitly.
- A task may depend on other tasks implicitly.

Here is an example of explicit task dependency:
[source]
----
tasks.register("hello") {
    println('Hello!')
}

tasks.register("greet") {
    println('How are you?')
    dependsOn("hello")
}
----

In this case, `hello` prints before `greet`. The output is `Hello! How are you?`.

Implicit dependencies are determined based on task inputs and outputs.

In this example, the input of the `doSomethingWithJar` task is the output of the `jar` task:

[source]
----
tasks.register("doSomethingWithJar") {
    inputFile.from(jar)
}
----

Thus, `jar` should be executed before `doSomethingWithJar`.

Task execution order is automatically determined by Gradle, taking into account explicit and implicit task dependencies.
If there is no dependency between tasks, Gradle enables users to request a specific execution order.
