[[gradle_wrapper]]
= Gradle Wrapper

The **recommended way to execute any Gradle build** is with the help of the Gradle Wrapper (referred to as "Wrapper").

The Wrapper is a script that invokes a declared version of Gradle, downloading it beforehand if necessary.
As a result, developers can get up and running with a Gradle project quickly.

In a nutshell, you gain the following benefits:

- Standardizes a project on a given Gradle version for more reliable and robust builds.
- Provisioning the Gradle version for different users is done with a simple Wrapper definition change.
- Provisioning the Gradle version for different execution environments (e.g., IDEs or Continuous Integration servers) is done with a simple Wrapper definition change.

== Using the Gradle Wrapper

It is always recommended to execute a build with the Wrapper to ensure a reliable, controlled, and standardized execution of the build.

Depending on the operating system you either run `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` instead of the `gradle` command.

To run the Wrapper on a Linux or OSX machine:

----
$ ./gradlew build
----

The following console output demonstrates the use of the Wrapper on a Windows machine for a Java-based project:

----
$ gradlew.bat build
include::{snippetsPath}/wrapper/simple/tests/wrapperBatchFileExecution.out[]
----

If the Gradle distribution is unavailable on the machine, the Wrapper will download it and store it in the local file system.
