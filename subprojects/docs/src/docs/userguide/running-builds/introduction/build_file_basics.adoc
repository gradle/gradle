[[build_file_basics]]
= Build File Basics

Every project has a build script that details build configuration, tasks, and plugins.

image::gradle-basic-4.png[]

Every Gradle build comprises at least one _build script_.

In the build file, two types of dependencies can be added:

1. The libraries and/or plugins on which Gradle and the build script depend.
2. The libraries on which the project sources (i.e. source code) depend.

[[sec:build_script]]
== Build scripts

The build script is either a `build.gradle` file written in Groovy or a `build.gradle.kts` file written in Kotlin.

The link:{groovyDslPath}/index.html[Groovy DSL^] and the link:{kotlinDslPath}/index.html[Kotlin DSL^] are the only accepted languages for Gradle scripts.

Let's take a look at an example and break it down:

====

=== 1. Add plugins
Plugins are bundled tasks used to extend Gradle.

Adding a plugin to a build is called _applying_ a plugin and makes additional functionality available.

[source]
----
plugins {
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm") version "1.9.0"
}
----

The Kotlin gradle plugin, version 1.9.0, has been applied to the project so that source code written in Kotlin can be used.

=== 2. Add repositories
A project generally has several dependencies it needs to do its work.
Many of the dependencies will be used by the source code.

In the example, the link:https://mvnrepository.com/[Maven Central^] repository has been added as the location for all the binaries that Gradle will need to download to build the project.

[source]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
----

In this example, the Kotlin JVM Plugin, `org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm`, will be downloaded by Gradle from the link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm/org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm.gradle.plugin[Maven Central Repository].

=== 3. Add dependencies
Dependencies are grouped in configurations and can be retrieved and uploaded from repositories.

In the example, a list of dependencies based on configurations (how/when/where Gradle will use it) is added, including the `junit` testing framework, which is used to test the Java source code.

[source]
----
dependencies {
    testImplementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test-junit5")
    testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.9.3")
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher")
    implementation("com.google.guava:guava:32.1.1-jre")
}
----

In this example, the source code in the project will import the Google `guava` library which will also be retrieved from the link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.guava/guava[Maven Central Repository] by Gradle.

=== 4. Use convention properties
A plugin adds tasks to a project.
It also adds properties and methods to a project.

In the example, the `application` plugin has a method that can declare the main class of a Java application, which is required to compile and run the code.

[source]
----
application {
    mainClass = "main"
}
