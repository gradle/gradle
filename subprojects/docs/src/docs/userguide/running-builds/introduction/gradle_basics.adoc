= Gradle Basics

Gradle *automates building, testing, and deployment of software* from information contained in *build scripts*.

== Gradle core concepts

=== Projects

A Gradle *project* is a piece of software that can be built, such an application or a library.

*Single project* builds include a single project called the *root project*.

*Multi-project* builds include *one root project* and *any number of subprojects*.

=== Build Scripts

*Build script* detail to Gradle what steps to take in order to build the project.

Each project can include one or more build script.

=== Dependency Management

*Dependency management* is an automated technique for declaring, resolving, and using functionality required by a project.

Each project typically includes a number of external dependencies that Gradle will resolve during the build.

=== Tasks

*Tasks are a basic unit of work* such as compiling code or running your test.

Each project contains one or more tasks, defined inside a build script or a plugin.

=== Plugins

Plugins are used to *extend Gradle's capability* and are essentially a *bundle of tasks*.

== Gradle project structure

Many developers will interact with Gradle for the first time through an existing project.

The presence of the `gradlew` and `gradle.bat` files in the root directory of a project is a clear indicator that Gradle is used.

A Gradle project will look similar to the following:

[source]
----
project
├── gradle                              // <1>
│   ├── libs.versions.toml              // <2>
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew                             // <3>
├── gradlew.bat                         // <3>
├── settings.gradle(.kts)               // <4>
├── subproject-a
│   ├── build.gradle(.kts)              // <5>
│   └── src                             // <6>
└── subproject-b
    ├── build.gradle(.kts)              // <5>
    └── logic                           // <6>
----
<1> Gradle wrapper files
<2> Gradle version catalog for dependency management
<3> Gradle wrapper scripts
<4> Gradle settings file to define a root project name and subprojects
<5> Gradle build scripts of the two subprojects - `subproject-a` and `subproject-b`
<6> Source code and/or additional files for the projects

== Invoking Gradle

=== Command line

Gradle can be invoked in the command line once <<installation.adoc#installation, installed>>.
For example:

[source]
----
$ gradle build
----

=== Gradle Wrapper

The Wrapper is a script that invokes a declared version of Gradle and is *the recommended way to execute a Gradle build*.
It is found in the project root directory as a `gradlew` or `gradle.bat` file:

[source]
----
$ gradlew build     // Linux or OSX
$ gradle.bat build  // Windows
----

=== IDE

Gradle is <<gradle_ides.adoc#gradle_ides,built-in to many IDEs>> including Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and NetBeans.

Gradle can be automatically invoked when you build, clean, or run your app in the IDE.

It is recommended that you consult the manual for the IDE of your choice to learn more about how Gradle can be used and configured.
