= Gradle Basics

Gradle *builds, test, and deploys projects from* information contained in *build scripts*.

== Gradle core principles

=== Projects

A Gradle project includes *one root project* and *any number of subprojects* detailed in the settings file.

=== Build Scripts

*Each project contains a build script* which details build steps to Gradle using the Groovy or Kotlin DSL.

=== Tasks

*Each project contains one or more tasks* defined inside a build script or a plugin which detail actions to Gradle.

=== Plugins

Plugins are used to *extend Gradle's capability* and are essentially a *bundle of tasks*.

== Gradle project structure

Many developers will interact with Gradle for the first time through an existing project.

The presence of the `gradlew` and `gradle.bat` file in the root directory of a project is a clear indicator that Gradle is used.

A Gradle project will look similar to the following:

[source]
----
project
├── gradle                              // <1>
│   ├── libs.versions.toml              // <2>
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
├── gradlew                             // <3>
├── gradlew.bat                         // <3>
├── settings.gradle(.kts)               // <4>
├── subproject-a
│   ├── build.gradle(.kts)              // <5>
│   └── src                             // <6>
└── subproject-b
    ├── build.gradle(.kts)              // <5>
    └── logic                           // <6>
----
<1> Gradle wrapper files
<2> Gradle version catalog for dependency management
<3> Gradle wrapper scripts
<4> Gradle settings file to define a root project name and subprojects
<5> Gradle build scripts of the two subprojects - `subproject-a` and `subproject-b`
<6> Source code and/or additional files for the projects

== Invoking Gradle

=== Command line

Gradle can be invoked in the command line once <<installation.adoc#installation, installed>>.
For example:

[source]
----
$ gradle build
----

=== Gradle Wrapper

The Wrapper is a script that invokes a declared version of Gradle and is *the recommended way to execute a Gradle build*.
It is found in the project root directory as a `gradlew` or `gradle.bat` file:

[source]
----
$ gradlew build     // Linux or OSX
$ gradle.bat build  // Windows
----

=== IDE

Gradle is built-in to many IDEs including Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and NetBeans.

Gradle is automatically invoked when you build, clean, or run your app in the IDE.

It is recommended that you consult the manual for the IDE of your choice to learn more about how Gradle is used.
