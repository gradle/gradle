= Configuring Gradle and the Build Environment

Gradle provides multiple mechanisms for configuring the behavior of Gradle itself and specific projects.
The following is a reference for using these mechanisms.

== Configuring Gradle

When configuring Gradle behavior, you can use these methods, listed in order of highest to lowest precedence (the first one wins):

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|===
|Order |Method |Example |Notes

|1
|<<command_line_interface#command_line_interface, Command-line flags>>
|`--build-cache`
|These have precedence over properties and environment variables.

|2
|<<#sec:gradle_system_properties, System properties>>
|`systemProp.http.proxyHost=somehost.org`
|Stored in a `gradle.properties` file in a root project directory.

|3
|<<#sec:gradle_configuration_properties, Gradle properties>>
|`org.gradle.caching=true`
|Typically stored in a `gradle.properties` file in a project directory or in the `<<directory_layout.adoc#dir:gradle_user_home,GRADLE_USER_HOME>>`.

|4
|<<#sec:gradle_environment_variables, Environment variables>>
|`GRADLE_OPTS`
|Sourced by the environment that executes Gradle.
|===

== Configuring your build environment
You can configure the build using the same mechanisms.

You can also read information about the environment in the build logic.

[[sec:gradle_command_line_flags]]
== 1. Command-line flags

The command line interface, along with the available flags, is described in <<command_line_interface#command_line_interface,its own section>>.


[[sec:gradle_system_properties]]
== 2. System properties

Using the `-D` command-line option, you can pass a system property to the JVM, which runs Gradle.

The `-D` option of the `gradle` command has the same effect as the `-D` option of the `java` command.

You can also set system properties in `gradle.properties` files with the prefix `systemProp`:

----
systemProp.gradle.wrapperUser=myuser
systemProp.gradle.wrapperPassword=mypassword
----

The following system properties are available:

`gradle.wrapperUser=(myuser)`::
Specify username to download Gradle distributions <<gradle_wrapper.adoc#sec:authenticated_download,from servers using HTTP Basic Authentication>>.
`gradle.wrapperPassword=(mypassword)`::
Specify password for downloading a Gradle distribution using the Gradle wrapper.
`gradle.user.home=(path to directory)`::
Specify the `GRADLE_USER_HOME` directory.
`https.protocols`::
Specify the supported TLS versions in a comma-separated format. For example: `TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3`.

In a multi-project build, `systemProp` properties set in any project except the root will be *ignored*.
Only the root project's `gradle.properties` file will be checked for properties that begin with `systemProp`.

The following examples demonstrate how to use System properties.

*Example 1:* Setting system properties with a `gradle.properties` file:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/systemProperties/groovy",files="gradle.properties[]"]
====

*Example 2:* Reading system properties at configuration time:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/systemProperties/kotlin",files="init.gradle.kts[];settings.gradle.kts[];build.gradle.kts[tags=system-properties]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/systemProperties/groovy",files="init.gradle[];settings.gradle[];build.gradle[tags=system-properties]"]
====

*Example 3:* Reading system properties for consumption at execution time:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/systemProperties/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=system-properties-task-inputs]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/systemProperties/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=system-properties-task-inputs]"]
====

*Example 4:* Setting system properties from the command line `-D gradle.wrapperUser=username`:
====
----
$ gradle -Dsystem=commandLineValue
----
====

[[sec:gradle_configuration_properties]]
== 3. Gradle properties

Gradle provides several options that make it easy to configure the Java process that will be used to execute your build.

While it's possible to configure these in your local environment via `GRADLE_OPTS` or `JAVA_OPTS`, it is useful to be able to store certain settings like JVM memory configuration and `JAVA_HOME` location in version control so that an entire team can work with a consistent environment.

To do so, place these settings into a `gradle.properties` file and commit it to your version control system.

The final configuration taken into account by Gradle is a combination of all Gradle properties set on the command line and your `gradle.properties` files.

If an option is configured in multiple locations, the _first one_ found in any of these locations wins:

. command line, set using `-D`.
. `gradle.properties` in `<<directory_layout.adoc#dir:gradle_user_home,GRADLE_USER_HOME>>` directory.
. `gradle.properties` in the project's directory, then its parent project's directory up to the build's root directory.
. `gradle.properties` in the Gradle installation directory.

NOTE: The location of the `GRADLE_USER_HOME` may have been changed beforehand via the `-Dgradle.user.home` system property passed on the command line.

The following properties can be used to configure the Gradle build environment:

`org.gradle.caching=(true,false)`::
When set to `true`, Gradle will reuse task outputs from any previous build when possible, <<build_cache.adoc#build_cache,resulting in much faster builds>>.
+
_Default is `false`; the build cache is *not* enabled._

`org.gradle.caching.debug=(true,false)`::
When set to `true`, individual input property hashes and the build cache key for each task are <<build_cache.adoc#sec:task_output_caching,logged on the console>>.
+
_Default is `false`._

`org.gradle.configuration-cache=(true,false)`::
Enables <<configuration_cache.adoc#config_cache:usage:enable, configuration caching>>. Gradle will try to reuse the build configuration from previous builds.
+
_Default is `false`._

`org.gradle.configuration-cache.problems=(fail,warn)`::
Configures how the configuration cache <<configuration_cache.adoc#config_cache:usage:ignore_problems, handles problems>>.
+
Set to `warn` to report problems without failing the build.
+
Set to `fail` to report problems and fail the build if there are any problems.
+
_Default is `fail`._

`org.gradle.configuration-cache.max-problems=(# of problems)`::
Configures the <<configuration_cache.adoc#config_cache:usage:max_problems, maximum number of configuration cache problems>> allowed as warnings until Gradle fails the build.
+
_Default is `512`._

`org.gradle.configureondemand=(true,false)`::
Enables incubating <<multi_project_configuration_and_execution.adoc#sec:configuration_on_demand, configuration on demand>>, where Gradle will attempt to configure only necessary projects.
+
_Default is `false`._

`org.gradle.console=(auto,plain,rich,verbose)`::
Customize <<command_line_interface.adoc#sec:command_line_logging,console output>> coloring or verbosity.
+
_Default depends on how Gradle is invoked._

`org.gradle.continuous.quietperiod=(# of quiet period millis)`::
When using <<command_line_interface.adoc#sec:continuous_build,continuous build>>, Gradle will wait for the quiet period to pass before triggering another build.
Any additional changes within this quiet period restart the quiet period countdown.
+
_Default is `250` milliseconds._

`org.gradle.daemon=(true,false)`::
When set to `true` the <<gradle_daemon.adoc#gradle_daemon, Gradle Daemon>> is used to run the build.
+
_Default is `true`._

`org.gradle.daemon.idletimeout=(# of idle millis)`::
Gradle Daemon will terminate itself after a specified number of idle milliseconds.
+
_Default is `10800000` (3 hours)._

`org.gradle.debug=(true,false)`::
When set to `true`, Gradle will run the build with remote debugging enabled, listening on port 5005.
Note that this is equivalent to adding `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005` to the JVM command line and will suspend the virtual machine until a debugger is attached.
+
_Default is `false`._

`org.gradle.debug.host=(host address)`::
Specifies the host address to listen on or connect to when debug is enabled.
In the server mode on Java 9 and above, passing `*` for the host will make the server listen on all network interfaces.
+
_Default is `null`; no host address is passed to JDWP (on Java 9 and above, the loopback address is used, while earlier versions listen on all interfaces)._

`org.gradle.debug.port=(port number)`::
Specifies the port number to listen on when debug is enabled.
+
_Default is `5005`._

`org.gradle.debug.server=(true,false)`::
If set to `true` and debugging is enabled, Gradle will run the build with the socket-attach mode of the debugger.
Otherwise, the socket-listen mode is used.
+
_Default is `true`._

`org.gradle.debug.suspend=(true,false)`::
When set to `true` and debugging is enabled, the JVM running Gradle will suspend until a debugger is attached.
+
_Default is `true`._

`org.gradle.java.home=(path to JDK home)`::
Specifies the Java home for the Gradle build process.
The value can be set to either a `jdk` or `jre` location; however, depending on what your build does, using a JDK is safer.
This does not affect the version of Java used to launch the <<#sec:gradle_environment_variables,Gradle client VM>>.
+
_Default is derived from your environment (`JAVA_HOME` or the path to `java`) if the setting is unspecified._

`org.gradle.jvmargs=(JVM arguments)`::
Specifies the JVM arguments used for the Gradle Daemon.
The setting is particularly useful for <<#sec:configuring_jvm_memory,configuring JVM memory settings>> for build performance.
This does not affect the JVM settings for the Gradle client VM.
+
_Default is `-Xmx512m "-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=384m"`._

`org.gradle.logging.level=(quiet,warn,lifecycle,info,debug)`::
When set to quiet, warn, lifecycle, info, or debug, Gradle will use this <<logging.adoc#sec:choosing_a_log_level,log level>>.
The values are not case-sensitive.
+
_Default is `lifecycle` level._

`org.gradle.logging.stacktrace=(internal,all,full)`::
Specifies whether stacktraces should be displayed as part of the build result upon an exception. See the <<command_line_interface.adoc#sec:command_line_debugging, `--stacktrace command-line option` for additional information>>.
+
When set to `internal`, a stacktrace is present in the output only in case of internal exceptions.
+
When set to `all` or `full`, a stacktrace is present in the output for all exceptions and build failures.
+
Using `full` doesn't truncate the stacktrace, which leads to a much more verbose output.
+
_Default is `internal`._

`org.gradle.parallel=(true,false)`::
When configured, Gradle will fork up to `org.gradle.workers.max` JVMs to execute <<performance.adoc#parallel_execution,projects in parallel>>.
+
_Default is `false`._

`org.gradle.priority=(low,normal)`::
Specifies the <<command_line_interface.adoc#sec:command_line_performance,scheduling priority>> for the Gradle daemon and all processes launched by it.
+
_Default is `normal`._

`org.gradle.vfs.verbose=(true,false)`::
Configures verbose logging when <<file_system_watching.adoc#sec:daemon_watch_fs,watching the file system>>.
+
_Default is `false`._

`org.gradle.vfs.watch=(true,false)`::
Toggles <<file_system_watching.adoc#sec:daemon_watch_fs,watching the file system>>.
When enabled, Gradle reuses information it collects about the file system between builds.
+
_Default is `true` on operating systems where Gradle supports this feature._

`org.gradle.warning.mode=(all,fail,summary,none)`::
When set to `all`, `summary` or `none`, Gradle will use <<command_line_interface.adoc#sec:command_line_logging,different warning type display>>.
+
_Default is `summary`._

`org.gradle.welcome=(never,once)`::
Controls whether Gradle should print a welcome message.
+
If set to `never`, then the welcome message will be suppressed.
+
If set to `once`, then the message is printed once for each new version of Gradle.
+
_Default is `once`._

`org.gradle.workers.max=(max # of worker processes)`::
When configured, Gradle will use a maximum of the <<command_line_interface.adoc#sec:command_line_performance,given number of workers>>.
+
_Default is the number of CPU processors._

The following examples demonstrate how to use Gradle properties.

*Example 1:* Setting Gradle properties with a `gradle.properties` file:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/gradleProperties/groovy",files="gradle.properties[tags=gradle-properties]"]
====

*Example 2:* Reading Gradle properties at configuration time:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/gradleProperties/kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[tags=gradle-properties];build.gradle.kts[tags=gradle-properties]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/gradleProperties/groovy",files="settings.gradle[tags=gradle-properties];build.gradle[tags=gradle-properties]"]
====

[.multi-language-text.lang-kotlin]
The link:https://kotlinlang.org/docs/delegated-properties.html[Kotlin delegated properties] are part of the Gradle Kotlin DSL.
You need to explicitly specify the type as `String`.
If you need to branch depending on the presence of the property, you can also use `String?` and check for `null`.

[.multi-language-text.lang-groovy]
Note that if a Gradle property has a dot in its name, using the dynamic Groovy names is not possible.
You have to use the API or the dynamic array notation instead.

*Example 3:* Reading Gradle properties for consumption at execution time:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/gradleProperties/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=gradle-properties-task-inputs]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/gradleProperties/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=gradle-properties-task-inputs]"]
====

*Example 4:* Setting Gradle properties from the command line:
====
----
$ gradle -DgradlePropertiesProp=commandLineValue
----
====

Note that <<init_scripts.adoc#init_scripts, initialization scripts>> can't read Gradle properties directly.
The earliest Gradle properties can be read in initialization scripts is on `settingsEvaluated {}`:

*Example 5:* Reading Gradle properties from initialization scripts:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/gradleProperties/kotlin",files="init.gradle.kts[tags=gradle-properties]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/gradleProperties/groovy",files="init.gradle[tags=gradle-properties]"]
====

Properties declared in a `gradle.properties` file present in a subproject directory are only available to that project and its children.

[[sec:gradle_environment_variables]]
== 4. Environment variables

The following environment variables are available for the `gradle` command.

`GRADLE_OPTS`::
Specifies JVM arguments to use when starting the Gradle client VM.
+
The client VM only handles command line input/output, so it is rare that one would need to change its VM options.
+
The actual build is run by the Gradle daemon, which is not affected by this environment variable.

`<<directory_layout.adoc#dir:gradle_user_home,GRADLE_USER_HOME>>`::
Specifies the `GRADLE_USER_HOME` directory.
+
Defaults to `<home directory of the current user>/.gradle` if not set.

`JAVA_HOME`::
Specifies the JDK installation directory to use for the client VM.
+
This VM is also used for the daemon unless a different one is specified in a Gradle properties file with `org.gradle.java.home`.

The following examples demonstrate how to use environment variables.

*Example 1:* Reading environment variables at configuration time:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/environmentVariables/kotlin",files="init.gradle.kts[];settings.gradle.kts[];build.gradle.kts[tags=configuration]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/environmentVariables/groovy",files="init.gradle[];settings.gradle[];build.gradle[tags=configuration]"]
====

*Example 2:* Reading environment variables for consumption at execution time:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/environmentVariables/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=execution]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/environmentVariables/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=execution]"]
====

[[sec:project_properties]]
== Project properties

Project properties are available on the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Project.html[Project] object.
They can be set from the command line using the `-P` / `--project-prop` <<command_line_interface.adoc#sec:environment_options, environment option>>.

The following examples demonstrate how to set project properties in different ways.

*Example 1:* Setting a project property via the *command line*:
====
----
$ gradle -PgradlePropertiesProp=commandLineValue
----
====

Gradle can also set project properties when it sees specially-named system properties or environment variables.
If the environment variable name looks like `ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT___prop__=somevalue`, then Gradle will set a `prop` property on your project object, with the value of `somevalue`.
Gradle also supports this for system properties, but with a different naming pattern, which looks like `org.gradle.project.__prop__`.
Both of the following will set the `foo' property on your Project object to `"bar"`.

*Example 2:* Setting a project property via a *system property*:
====
----
org.gradle.project.foo=bar
----
====

*Example 3:* Setting a project property via an *environment variable*:
====
----
ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_foo=bar
----
====

This feature is useful when you don't have admin rights to a continuous integration server and you need to set property values that should not be easily visible.
Since you cannot use the `-P` option in that scenario nor change the system-level configuration files, the correct strategy is to change the configuration of your continuous integration build job, adding an environment variable setting that matches an expected pattern.
This won't be visible to normal users on the system.

The following examples demonstrate how to use project properties.

*Example 1:* Reading project properties at configuration time:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/projectProperties/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=configuration]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/projectProperties/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=configuration]"]
====

[.multi-language-text.lang-kotlin]
The link:https://kotlinlang.org/docs/delegated-properties.html[Kotlin delegated properties] are part of the Gradle Kotlin DSL.
You need to explicitly specify the type as `String`.
If you need to branch depending on the presence of the property, you can also use `String?` and check for `null`.

[.multi-language-text.lang-groovy]
Note that if a Project property has a dot in its name, using the dynamic Groovy names is not possible.
You have to use the API or the dynamic array notation instead.

*Example 2:* Reading project properties for consumption at execution time:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/projectProperties/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=execution]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/projectProperties/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=execution]"]
====

[NOTE]
====
If a project property is referenced but does not exist, an exception will be thrown, and the build will fail.

You should check for the existence of optional project properties before you access them using the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Project.html#org.gradle.api.Project:hasProperty(java.lang.String)[Project.hasProperty(java.lang.String)] method.
====

[[sec:configuring_jvm_memory]]
== Configuring JVM memory

The `org.gradle.jvmargs` Gradle property controls the VM running the build.
It defaults to `-Xmx512m "-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=384m"`

You can adjust JVM options for Gradle in the following ways.

*Option 1:* Changing JVM settings for the build VM:
====
----
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
----
====

The `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable controls the command line client, which is only used to display console output. It defaults to `-Xmx64m`

*Option 2:* Changing JVM settings for the client VM:
====
----
JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx64m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"
----
====

[NOTE]
====
There is one case where the client VM can also serve as the build VM:

If you deactivate the <<gradle_daemon.adoc#gradle_daemon, Gradle Daemon>> and the client VM has the same settings as required for the build VM, the client VM will run the build directly.

Otherwise, the client VM will fork a new VM to run the actual build in order to honor the different settings.
====

Certain tasks, like the `test` task, also fork additional JVM processes.
You can configure these through the tasks themselves.
They use `-Xmx512m` by default.

*Example 1:* Set compile options for Java compilation tasks:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildEnvironment/javaCompileOptions/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildEnvironment/javaCompileOptions/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
====

See other examples in the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test] API documentation and <<java_testing.adoc#sec:test_execution, test execution in the Java plugin reference>>.

link:https://scans.gradle.com[Build scans] will tell you information about the JVM that executed the build when you use the `--scan` option:

[caption= "Build Environment in build scans",link=https://scans.gradle.com/s/sample/cpp-parallel/infrastructure]
image::build-scan-infrastructure.png[Build Environment in Build Scan]

[[sec:configuring_task_using_project_properties]]
== Configuring a task using project properties

It is possible to change the behavior of a task based on project properties specified at invocation time.

Suppose you would like to ensure release builds are only triggered by CI.
A simple way to do this is using the `isCI` project property.

*Example 1:* Prevent releasing outside of CI:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/configureTaskUsingProjectProperty/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/configureTaskUsingProjectProperty/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
----
$ gradle performRelease -PisCI=true --quiet
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/configureTaskUsingProjectProperty/tests/configureTaskUsingProjectProperty.out[]
----
====

[[sec:accessing_the_web_via_a_proxy]]
== Accessing the web through a proxy

Configuring a proxy (for downloading dependencies, for example) is done via standard JVM system properties.

These properties can be set directly in the build script.
For example, setting the HTTP proxy host would be done with `System.setProperty('http.proxyHost', 'www.somehost.org')`.

Alternatively, the properties can be <<#sec:gradle_configuration_properties,specified in `gradle.properties`>>.

*Example 1:* Configuring an HTTP proxy using `gradle.properties`:
====
----
systemProp.http.proxyHost=www.somehost.org
systemProp.http.proxyPort=8080
systemProp.http.proxyUser=userid
systemProp.http.proxyPassword=password
systemProp.http.nonProxyHosts=*.nonproxyrepos.com|localhost
----
====

There are separate settings for HTTPS.

*Example 2:* Configuring an HTTPS proxy using `gradle.properties`:
====
----
systemProp.https.proxyHost=www.somehost.org
systemProp.https.proxyPort=8080
systemProp.https.proxyUser=userid
systemProp.https.proxyPassword=password
# NOTE: this is not a typo.
systemProp.http.nonProxyHosts=*.nonproxyrepos.com|localhost
----
====

There are separate settings for SOCKS.

*Example 3:* Configuring a SOCKS proxy using `gradle.properties`:
====
----
systemProp.socksProxyHost=www.somehost.org
systemProp.socksProxyPort=1080
systemProp.java.net.socks.username=userid
systemProp.java.net.socks.password=password
----
====

You may need to set other properties to access other networks.

* link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/proxies.html[JDK 8 Proxies^]

=== NTLM Authentication

If your proxy requires NTLM authentication, you may need to provide the authentication domain as well as the username and password.

There are 2 ways that you can provide the domain for authenticating to a NTLM proxy:

* Set the `http.proxyUser` system property to a value like `__domain__/__username__`.
* Provide the authentication domain via the `http.auth.ntlm.domain` system property.
