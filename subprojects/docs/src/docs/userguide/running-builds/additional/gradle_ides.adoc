= Gradle in IDEs

Many IDEs support Gradle including Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and NetBeans.

== IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ IDEA supports a fully-functional integration with Gradle that helps you automate your building process.

You can easily create a new Gradle project, open and sync an existing one, work with several linked projects simultaneously, and manage them.

You can find documentation link:https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html[here].

== Android Studio

The Android build system compiles app resources and source code.
It then packages them into APKs or Android App Bundles that you can test, deploy, sign, and distribute.

Android Studio uses Gradle to automate and manage the build process while letting you define flexible, custom build configurations.

VS Code supports Gradle Java projects (not including Android) via the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-gradle[Gradle for Java extension].

The extension provides a visual interface for your Gradle build.
You can use this interface to view Gradle Tasks and Project dependencies, or run Gradle Tasks as VS Code Tasks. The extension also offers a better Gradle build file authoring experience including syntax highlighting, error reporting, and auto-completion.

You can find documentation link:https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-build[here].

== Eclipse

The Eclipse IDE caters to the Java developer, including a Java IDE, a Git client, XML Editor, and Gradle integration.
