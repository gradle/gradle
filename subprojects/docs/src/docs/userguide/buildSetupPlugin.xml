    <title>Build Setup Plugin</title>

    <note>
        <para>
            The build setup plugin is currently<link linkend="feature_lifecycle">incubating</link>. Please be aware that the DSL and other configuration may change in later Gradle versions.
        </para>
    </note>

    <para>The Gradle build setup plugin prepares the current project for Gradle.
        Typically it will create the relevant build.gradle, settings.gradle files.
        If a
        <filename>pom.xml</filename>
        file is found in the project directory the Maven build is
        converted to a Gradle build. At the moment only the conversion from Maven 3 is supported.
    </para>
    <para>
        The plugin is currently <link linkend="feature_lifecycle">incubating</link>
        which means it is already useful but not everything might work perfectly.
        The API, plugin and task names may change before the final release.
        Please let us know your feedback or report any issues.
    </para>
    <para>
        This plugin provides a lifecycle task named <literal>setupBuild</literal>.
        If a Gradle build with the task name <literal>setupBuild</literal> is triggered in a directory
        without an existing build file in the project directory, the build setup plugin is auto applied.
        This means that you can setup a Gradle project build without needing a stub build.gradle file declaring
        the build-setup plugin.

        If a pom.xml file is found in the project directory the <literal>setupBuild</literal> task triggers the maven2Gradle
        conversion to create gradle build scripts from the information gathered from the pom file.

        Furthermore the <literal>setupBuild</literal> task adds a dependency to the <literal>wrapper</literal>
        task which is implicitly added by the<xref linkend='wrapper_plugin'/>.
    </para>
    <section>
        <title>Tasks</title>
        <para>The build-setup plugin adds the following tasks to the project:</para>

        <section>
            <title>Generate specific project types</title>
            <para>
                The build-setup plugin allows the generation of specific project types by passing the type via <literal>--type</literal>
                command-line option. For example generating a java library project you can run <code>gradle setupBuild --type java-library</code>
                in an empty directory. When passing a <literal>--type</literal> parameter to the <literal>setupBuild</literal>
                task, any pom file will be ignored for automatic conversion.
            </para>

            <section>
                <title>Empty Gradle Project</title>
                <para>The
                    build setup type with id <literal>empty</literal> is the default type, when executing
                    <literal>setupBuild</literal> in a directory with no existing gradle files and no existing pom file.
                    This build setup type generates
                    <itemizedlist>
                        <listitem>a sample  <literal>build.gradle</literal> with comments and links to get started.
                        </listitem>

                <title>Maven conversion</title>
                <para>The
                    build setup type with id <literal>pom</literal> is the default type, when executing
                    <literal>setupBuild</literal> in a directory with an existing pom file.
                    This build setup type triggers the <literal>maven2Gradle</literal> conversion.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The convertion of a pom to gradle build scripts works by obtaining the effective POM of the current project
                    by executing Maven internally. Then it reads the dependencies and other information
                    to generate build.gradle scripts. This task is inspired by the
                    <ulink url="https://github.com/jbaruch/maven2gradle">maven2gradle tool</ulink>
                    founded and maintained by recognized leaders of Gradle community;
                    created by Baruch Sadogursky with contributions from Antony Stubbs, Matthew McCullough and others.

                    (*) - Note: Your project will be considered multi-module
                    only if your reactor is also a parent of at least one of your modules.
                    Why so? Reactor project is built last, when Parent project is built first.
                    The reactor has to be built first, because effective-pom Mojo generates needed output
                    only if it finds modules in first project it encounters.
                    Making reactor also a parent achieves this.
