    <title>The Build Dashboard Plugin</title>
    <note>
        <para>
            The build dashboard plugin is currently <link linkend="feature_lifecycle">incubating</link>. Please be aware that the DSL and other configuration may change in later Gradle versions.
        </para>
    </note>

    <para>
        The Build Dashboard plugin can be used to generate a single HTML dashboard that provides a single point of
        access to all of the reports generated by a build.
    </para>

    <section>
        <title>Usage</title>
        <para>To use the Build Dashboard plugin, include the following in your build script:</para>
        <sample id="useBuildDashboardPlugin" dir="buildDashboard" title="Using the Build Dashboard plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-build-dashboard-plugin"/>
        </sample>
        <para>
            Applying the plugin adds the <literal>buildDashboard</literal> task to your project.
            The task aggregates the reports for all tasks that implement the <apilink class="org.gradle.api.reporting.Reporting" />
            interface from <emphasis>all projects</emphasis> in the build.
            It is typically only applied to the root project.
        </para>
        <para>
            The <literal>buildDashboard</literal> task does not depend on any other tasks. It will only aggregate the reporting tasks that are independently
            being executed as part of the build run. To generate the build dashboard, simply include the <literal>buildDashboard</literal> task in the list of tasks to execute.
            For example, <userinput>gradle buildDashboard build</userinput> will generate a dashboard for all of the reporting tasks that are dependents of the <literal>build</literal> task.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
