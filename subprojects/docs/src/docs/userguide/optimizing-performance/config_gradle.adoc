== Configuring Gradle

[[sec:configuring_jvm_memory]]
== Configuring JVM memory

The `org.gradle.jvmargs` Gradle property controls the VM running the build.
It defaults to `-Xmx512m "-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=384m"`

You can adjust JVM options for Gradle in the following ways.

*Option 1:* Changing JVM settings for the build VM:
====
----
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
----
====

The `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable controls the command line client, which is only used to display console output. It defaults to `-Xmx64m`

*Option 2:* Changing JVM settings for the client VM:
====
----
JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx64m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"
----
====

[NOTE]
====
There is one case where the client VM can also serve as the build VM:

If you deactivate the <<gradle_daemon.adoc#gradle_daemon, Gradle Daemon>> and the client VM has the same settings as required for the build VM, the client VM will run the build directly.

Otherwise, the client VM will fork a new VM to run the actual build in order to honor the different settings.
====

Certain tasks, like the `test` task, also fork additional JVM processes.
You can configure these through the tasks themselves.
They use `-Xmx512m` by default.

*Example 1:* Set compile options for Java compilation tasks:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildEnvironment/javaCompileOptions/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/buildEnvironment/javaCompileOptions/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
====

See other examples in the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html[Test] API documentation and <<java_testing.adoc#sec:test_execution, test execution in the Java plugin reference>>.

link:https://scans.gradle.com[Build scans] will tell you information about the JVM that executed the build when you use the `--scan` option:

[[sec:configuring_task_using_project_properties]]
== Configuring a task using project properties

It is possible to change the behavior of a task based on project properties specified at invocation time.

Suppose you would like to ensure release builds are only triggered by CI.
A simple way to do this is using the `isCI` project property.

*Example 1:* Prevent releasing outside of CI:
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/configureTaskUsingProjectProperty/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/configureTaskUsingProjectProperty/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
----
$ gradle performRelease -PisCI=true --quiet
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/configureTaskUsingProjectProperty/tests/configureTaskUsingProjectProperty.out[]
