    <title>C++ Support</title>

    <note>
        <para>
            The Gradle C++ support is experimental and in very early stages of development so should not be considered stable.
        </para>
    </note>

    <para>
        The C++ plugins add support for building software comprised of C++ source code, and managing the process of building “native” software in general.
        While many excellent build tools exist for this space of software development, Gradle brings the dependency management practices more traditionally
        found in the JVM development space to C++ developers.
    </para>
    <para>
        Currently, support is restricted to building with the <literal>g++</literal> (i.e. the C++ focussed frontend to <ulink url="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</ulink>)
        compiler/linker. Furthermore, there is no direct support for creating multiple variants of the same binary (e.g. 32 bit vs. 64 bit) and there is no direct
        support for cross platform source configuration (à la <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/s/autoconf/">autoconf</ulink>) at this time. Support for different
        compiler chains, managing multiple variants and cross platform source configuration will be added over time, making Gradle a fully capable build tool for C++
        (and other “native” language) projects.
    </para>

    <section>
        <title>Usage</title>
        <para>
            The build scripts DSLs, model elements and tasks used to manage C++ projects are added by the <literal>cpp</literal> plugin. However, it is typically
            more convenient to use either the <literal>cpp-lib</literal> or <literal>cpp-exe</literal> plugins that sit on top of the <literal>cpp</literal>
            plugin to preconfigure the project to build either a shared library or executable binary respectively.
        </para>
        <sample id="useCppExePlugin" dir="cpp/dependencies" title="Using the 'cpp-exe' plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-plugin-exe"/>
        </sample>
        <sample id="useCppLibPlugin" dir="cpp/dependencies" title="Using the 'cpp-lib' plugin">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-plugin-lib"/>
        </sample>
        <para>
            The <literal>cpp-exe</literal> plugin configures the project to build a single executable (at <filename>$buildDir/binaries/main</filename>) and
            the <literal>cpp-lib</literal> plugin configures the project to build a single shared library (at <filename>$buildDir/binaries/main.so</filename>).
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Source code locations</title>
        <para>
            Both plugins configure the project to look for <literal>.cpp</literal> source files in <literal>src/main/cpp</literal> and use the <literal>src/main/headers</literal>
            directory as a header include root. For a library, the header files in <literal>src/main/headers</literal> are considered the “public” or “exported” headers.
            Header files that should not be exported (but are used internally) should be placed inside the <literal>src/main/cpp</literal> directory (though be aware that
            such header files should always be referenced in a manner relative to the file including them).
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Compiling</title>
        <para>
            For both the <literal>cpp-lib</literal> and <literal>cpp-exe</literal> plugins, you can run the <literal>compileMain</literal> task.
        </para>
        <para>
            As previously stated, the C++ support is currently based on the <literal>g++</literal> tool which must be installed and on the <literal>PATH</literal>
            for the Gradle process.
        </para>
        <para>Arbitrary arguments can be provided to <literal>g++</literal> by using the following syntax:</para>
        <sample id="gppArgs" dir="cpp/exe" title="Supplying arbitrary args to gpp">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="args"/>
        </sample>
        <para>
            The above example applies to the <literal>cpp-exe</literal> plugin, to supply arguments for the <literal>cpp-lib</literal> plugin replace
            “<literal>executables</literal>” with “<literal>libraries</literal>”.
        </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Dependencies</title>
        <para>
            Dependencies for C++ projects are binary libraries that export header files. The header files are used during compilation, with the compiled
            binary dependency being used during the linking.
        </para>
        <section>
            <title>External Dependencies</title>
            <para>
                External dependencies (i.e. from a repository, not a subproject) must be specified using the following syntax:
            </para>
            <sample id="gppArgs" dir="cpp/dependencies" title="Declaring dependencies">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="declaring-dependencies"/>
            </sample>
            <para>
                Each dependency must be specified with the <literal>dependency</literal> method as above and must be declared as part of the source set. The
                <literal>group</literal>, <literal>name</literal> and <literal>version</literal> arguments <emphasis>must</emphasis> be supplied.
            </para>
            <para>
                For each declared dependency, two actual dependencies are created. One with the classifer “<literal>headers</literal>” and extension
                “<literal>zip</literal>” which is a zip file of the exported headers, and another with the classifier “<literal>so</literal>” and extension
                “<literal>so</literal>” which is the compiled library binary to link against (which is supplied as a direct input to the g++ link operation).
            </para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Project Dependencies</title>
            <para>
                The notation for project dependencies is slightly different.
            </para>
            <sample id="cppProjectDependencies" dir="cpp/exewithlib" title="Declaring project dependencies">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="project-dependencies"/>
            </sample>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Publishing</title>
        <para>
            The <literal>cpp-exe</literal> and <literal>cpp-lib</literal> plugins configure their respective output binaries to be publishable as part of the
            <literal>archives</literal> configuration. To publish, simply configure the <literal>uploadArchives</literal> task as per usual.
        </para>
        <sample id="cppPublish" dir="cpp/dependencies" title="Uploading exe or lib">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="upload"/>
        </sample>
        <para>
            The <literal>cpp-exe</literal> plugin publishes a single artifact with extension “<literal>exe</literal>”. The <literal>cpp-lib</literal> plugin
            publishes two artifacts; one with classifier “<literal>headers</literal>” and extension “<literal>zip</literal>”, and one with classifier
            “<literal>so</literal>” and extension “<literal>so</literal>” (which is the format used when consuming dependencies).
        </para>
        <note>
            <para>
                Currently, there is no support for publishing the dependencies of artifacts in POM or Ivy files. Future versions will support this.
            </para>
