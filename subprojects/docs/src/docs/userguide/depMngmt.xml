        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Gradle offers a very good support for dependency management. If you are familiar with Maven or Ivy approach you will be delighted to learn that:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>Gradle fully supports transitive dependency management. Gradle also works <emphasis>perfectly</emphasis> with your existent dependency management
                    infrastructure, be it Maven or Ivy. All the repositories you have set up with your custom POM or
                    ivy files can be used as they are. No changes necessary.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>If you don't use transitive dependency management and your external libraries live just as files in version control or on some shared drive, Gradle provides powerful functionality
                    to support this.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Gradle provides an additional, optional support for transitive dependency management that is not based on XML descriptor files called Module Dependencies, where you describe
                    the dependency hierarchy in the build script.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The job of a build system is to support all major patterns for how people deal with dependencies, not to force people in a certain way of doing things. In particular for migration scenarios
                    it is extremely important that any current approach is supported so that you can use the same input structure in the new evolving Gradle build than in the existing build as long as it
                    is in production. That enables you to compare the results. Gradle is extremely flexible. So even if your project is using a custom dependency management or say an Eclipse .classpath file as master data for dependency management,
                    it would be very easy to write a little adaptor plugin to use this data in Gradle. For migration purposes this is a common technique with Gradle. Once you have migrated, it might be a good idea though not to
                    use a .classpath file for dependency metadata any longer :).

    <section id='sec:dependency_management_overview'>
        <title>Dependency Management Best Practices.</title>
        <para>We have an opinion on what are dependency management best practices. As usual, Gradle does not force our opinion onto you, but supports any kind of pattern you want to use. Nonetheless
            we would like to share our opinion.
        </para>
        <para>We think good dependency management is very important for almost any project. Yet the kind of dependency
            management you need depends on the complexity and the environment of your project. Is your project a
            distribution or a library? Is it part of an enterprise environment, where it is integrated into other
            projects builds or not? But all types of projects should follow the rules below:
        </para>
        <section id='sub:versioning_the_jar_name'>
            <title>Versioning the jar name</title>
            <para>The version of the jar must be easy to recognize. Sometimes the version is in the Manifest file of
                the jar, often not. And even if, it is rather painful to always look into the Manifest file to learn
                about the version. Therefore we think that you should only use jars which have their version as part
                of their file name. If you are using transitive dependency management you are forced to do this in any case.
            </para>
            <para>Why do we think this is important? Without a dependency management as described above, your are likely
                to burn your fingers sooner or later. If it is unclear which version of a jar your are using, this can
                introduce subtle bugs which are very hard to find. For example there might be a project which uses
                Hibernate 3.0.4. There are some problems with Hibernate so a developer installs version 3.0.5 of
                Hibernate on her machine. This did not solve the problem but she forgot to roll back Hibernate to 3.0.4.
                Weeks later there is an exception on the integration machine which can't be reproduced on the developer
                machine. Without a version in the jar name this problem might take a long time to debug. Version in the
                jar names increases the expressiveness of your project and makes it easier to maintain.
            </para>
        </section>
        <section id='sub:transitive_dependency_management'>
            <title>Use some form of transitive dependency management</title>
            <para>When we talk about transitive dependency management, we mean any technique that enables to distinguish
                between what are the first level dependencies and what are the transitive ones. We will about different techniques for this later on.
            </para>
            <para>Why is transitive dependency management so important? If you don't know which dependencies are first
                level dependencies and which ones are transitive you will soon lose control over your build. Even a non enterprise project
                Gradle has already 100+ jars. An enterprise project using Spring, Hibernate, etc. easily ends up with
                many more jars. There is no way to memorize where all these jars come from. If you want to get rid of a first
                level dependency you can't be sure which other jars you should remove. Because a dependency of a
                first level dependency might also be a first level dependency itself. Or it might be a transitive
                dependency of another of your first level dependencies. Many first level dependencies are runtime
                dependencies and the transitive dependencies are of course all runtime dependencies. So the compiler
                won't help you much here. The end of the story is, as we have seen very often, no one dares to remove
                any jar any longer. The project classpath is a complete mess and if a classpath problem arises, hell on
                earth invites you for a ride. In one of our former projects, we found some ldap related jar in the
                classpath, whose sheer presence, as we found out after much research, accelerated LDAP access. So
                removing this jar would not have led to any errors at compile or runtime.
            </para>
            <para>Gradle offers you different ways to express what are first level and what are transitive dependencies.
                Gradle allows you for example to store your jars in CVS or SVN without XML descriptor files and still
                use transitive dependency management. Also, not all techniques for transitive dependency management deal with
                the problem described above equally well.
            </para>
        </section>
        <section id='sub:version_conflicts'>
            <title>Version conflicts</title>
            <para>Conflicting versions of the same jar should be detected and either resolved or cause an exception. If you don't use
                transitive dependency management, version conflicts are undetected and the mostly accidental fragile order of the classpath
                will determine, what version of a dependency will win. For example adding a dependency with a particular version to a subproject
                might change that order and then will led to all kind of surprising side effects. You might also want to learn where conflicting
                versions are used as you might want to consolidate on a particular version of an dependency across your organization. With a good conflict
                reporting that information can be used to communicate with the teams to solve this.
            </para>
            <para>It is common that different dependencies rely on different versions of
                another dependency which leads to a version conflictm as The JVM unfortunately does not offer yet any easy way, to have different versions of
                the same jar in the classpath (see <xref linkend='sub:dependency_management_and_java'/>).</para>
            <para>Gradle offers following conflict resolution strategies:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem><emphasis>Newest</emphasis> - used by default by Gradle - the newest version of the dependency is used.
                    This strategy has been in Gradle since early days.
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem><emphasis>Fail</emphasis> - fail eagerly on version conflict.
                        Useful if you need extra control and manage the conflicts manually.
                        Introduced in <code>1.0-milestone-6</code>. See <apilink class='org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy'/> for reference on managing the conflict resolution strategies.
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>We are working on making conflict resolution fully customizable.
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
                Gradle provides means to resolve version conflicts:
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        Configuring a first level dependency as <emphasis>forced</emphasis>.
                        The feature has been in Gradle since early days.
                        This approach is useful if the dependency incurring conflict is already a first level dependency.
                        See examples in <apilink class='org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler'/>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        Configuring any dependency (transitive or not) as <emphasis>forced</emphasis>.
                        The feature was introduced in <code>1.0-milestone-7</code>.
                        This approach is useful if the dependency incurring conflict is a transitive dependency.
                        It also can be used to force versions of first level dependencies.
                        See examples in <apilink class='org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy'/>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
                To deal with problems due to version conflicts, reports with dependency graphs are also very helpful.
                Such reports are another feature of dependency management.

        <section id='sub:dynamic_versions_and_changing_modules'>
            <title>Dynamic Versions and Changing Modules</title>
            <para>Sometimes, you always want to use the latest version of a particular dependency, or the latest in a range of versions.
                You can easily do this using a <emphasis>dynamic version</emphasis>. A dynamic version can be either a version range (eg. <literal>2.+</literal>)
                or it can be a placeholder for the latest version available (eg. <literal>latest.integration</literal>).
            </para>
            <para>Alternatively, sometimes the module you request can change over time, even for the same version.
                An example of this type of <emphasis>changing module</emphasis> is a maven <literal>SNAPSHOT</literal> module,
                which always points at the latest artifacts published.
            </para>
            <para>
                The main difference between a <emphasis>dynamic version</emphasis> and a <emphasis>changing module</emphasis> is
                that when you resolve a <emphasis>dynamic version</emphasis>, you'll get the real, static version as the module name.
                When you resolve a <emphasis>changing module</emphasis>, the artifacts are named using the version you requested,
                but the underlying artifacts may change over time.
            </para>
            <para>By default, Gradle caches dynamic versions and changing modules for 24 hours.
                You can override the default cache modes using <link linkend="sec:cache_command_line_options">command line options</link>.
                You can change the cache expiry times in your build using the <literal>resolution strategy</literal> (see <xref linkend='sec:controlling_caching'/>).
            </para>
        </section>
        <section id='sub:dependency_management_and_java'>
            <title>Dependency management and Java</title>
            <para>Traditionally, Java has offered no support at all for dealing with libraries and versions. There are
                no standard ways to say that
                <literal>foo-1.0.jar</literal>
                depends on a <literal>bar-2.0.jar</literal>. This has led to proprietary solutions. The most popular ones
                are Maven and Ivy. Maven is a complete build system whereas Ivy focuses solely on dependency management.
            </para>
            <para>Both approaches rely on descriptor XML files, which contains information about the dependencies of a
                particular jar. Both also use repositories where the actual jars are placed together with their
                descriptor files. And both offer resolution for conflicting jar versions in one form or the other. Yet
                we think the differences of both approaches are significant
                in terms of flexibility and maintainability. Originally Gradle did use Ivy under the
                hood for its dependency management. This has been replaced with a native Gradle dependency resolution engine. This resolution engine
                supports both pom and ivy descriptor files.

    </section>
    <section id='sub:configurations'>
        <title>Dependency configurations</title>
        <para>In Gradle dependencies are grouped into configurations. Configurations have a name, a number of other properties,
            and they can extend each other.
            Many Gradle plugin add pre-defined configurations to your project. The Java plugin, for example,
            adds some configurations to represent the various classpaths it needs. see <xref linkend='sec:java_plugin_and_dependency_management'/>
            for details. Of course you can add your add custom configurations on top of that. There are many use cases
            for custom configurations. This is very handy for example for adding dependencies not needed for
            building or testing your software (e.g. additional JDBC drivers to be shipped with your distribution).
        </para>
        <para>
            A project's configurations are managed by a <literal>configurations</literal> object. The closure you pass to
            the configurations object is applied against its API. To learn more about this API have a look at
            <apilink class='org.gradle.api.artifacts.ConfigurationContainer'/>.

            </para>
            <para>Gradle provides different notations for module dependencies. There is a string notation and
                a map notation. A module dependency has an API which allows for further configuration. Have a look at
                <apilink class='org.gradle.api.artifacts.ExternalModuleDependency'/> to learn all about the API.
                This API provides properties and configuration methods. Via the string notation you can define a subset
                the properties. With the map notation you can define all properties. To have access to the complete API,
                either with the map or with the string notation, you can assign a single dependency to a configuration
                together with a closure.
            </para>
            <para>If you declare a module dependency, Gradle looks for a corresponding module descriptor file (<literal>pom.xml</literal> or
                <literal>ivy.xml</literal>) in the repositories. If such a module descriptor file exists, it is parsed and the artifacts of
                this module (e.g. <literal>hibernate-3.0.5.jar</literal>) as well as its dependencies (e.g. cglib) are downloaded. If no such
                module descriptor file exists, Gradle looks for a file called <literal>hibernate-3.0.5.jar</literal> to retrieve. In Maven
                a module can only have one and only one artifact. In Gradle and Ivy a module can have multiple artifacts.
                Each artifact can have a different set of dependencies.
            </para>
            <section id='ssub:multi_artifact_dependencies'>
                <title>Depending on modules with multiple artifacts</title>
                As mentioned earlier, a maven module has only one artifact. So, when your project depends on a maven module
                it's obvious what artifact is the actual dependency.
                With Gradle or Ivy the case is different. Ivy model of dependencies (<literal>ivy.xml</literal>) can declare multiple artifacts.
                For more information, see Ivy reference for <literal>ivy.xml</literal>.
                In Gradle, when you declare a dependency on an ivy module you actually declare dependency on the <literal>'default'</literal> configuration of that module.
                So the actual list of artifacts (typically jars) your project depends on, are all artifacts that are attached to the <literal>default</literal> configuration of that module.
                This is very important in following exemplary use cases:

                <para>As said above, if no module descriptor file can be found, Gradle by default
                    downloads a jar with the name of the module. But sometimes, even if the repository contains module descriptors,  you want to download only the artifact jar, without
                    the dependencies.

                    And sometimes you want to download a zip from a repository, that does not have module descriptors.
                    Gradle provides an <emphasis>artifact only</emphasis> notation for those use cases - simply prefix the extension that you want to be downloaded with <literal>'@'</literal> sign:

                If you want to exclude a transitive dependency from all your
                configurations you can use the Groovy spread-dot operator to express this in a concise way, as shown in the example.
                When defining an exclude, you can
                specify either only the organization or only the module name or both.
                Have also a look at the API documentation of <apilink class="org.gradle.api.artifacts.Dependency"/> and

                Not every transitive dependency can be excluded - some transitive dependencies might be essential
                for correct runtime behavior of the application. Generally, one can exclude transitive
                dependencies that are either not required by runtime or that are guaranteed to be available
                on the target environment/platform.
            </para>
            <para>
                Should you exclude per-dependency or per-configuration?
                It turns out that in majority of cases you want to use the per-configuration exclusion.
                Here are the some exemplary reasons why one might want to exclude a transitive dependency.
                Bear in mind that for some of those use cases there are better solutions than exclusions!
                <itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>The dependency is undesired due to licensing reasons.</listitem>
                    <listitem>The dependency is not available in any of remote repositories.</listitem>
                    <listitem>The dependency is not needed for runtime.</listitem>
                    <listitem>The dependency has a version that conflicts with a desired version.
                        For that use case please refer to <xref linkend='sub:version_conflicts'/>
                        and the documentation on <apilink class='org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy'/>
                        for a potentially better solution to the problem.
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>
                Basically, in most of the cases excluding the transitive dependency should be done per configuration.
                This way the dependency declaration is more explicit. It is also more accurate because a per-dependency
                exclude rule does not guarantee the given transitive dependency does not show up in the configuration.
                For example, some other dependency, which does not have any exclude rules, might pull in
                that unwanted transitive dependency.

                    If a module or artifact has not been previously resolved from <emphasis>this repository</emphasis>, Gradle will attempt to resolve the module
                    against the repository. This will always involve a remote lookup on the repository, however in many cases no download will be required (see <xref linkend='sub:cache_artifact_reuse'/>, below).</para>
                <para>Dependency resolution will fail if the required artifacts are not available in any repository specified by the build,
                    regardless whether the local cache has retrieved this artifact from a different repository.
                    Repository independence allows builds to be isolated from each other in an advanced way that no build tool has done before.
                    This is a key feature to create builds that are reliable and reproducible in any environment.</para>

                <title>Artifact reuse</title>
                <para>Before downloading an artifact, Gradle tries to determine the checksum of the required artifact by downloading the sha file associated
                    with that artifact. If the checksum can be retrieved, an artifact is not downloaded if an artifact already exists with the same id and checksum.
                    If the checksum cannot be retrieved from the remote server, the artifact will be downloaded (and ignored if it matches an existing artifact).</para>
                <para>As well as considering artifacts downloaded from a different repository, Gradle will also attempt to reuse artifacts found in the local Maven Repository.
                    If a candidate artifact has been downloaded by Maven, Gradle will use this artifact if it can be verified to match the checksum declared by the remote server.</para>

                <title>Checksum based storage</title>
                <para>
                    It is possible for different repositories to provide a different binary artifact in response to the same artifact identifier. This is often the case with Maven SNAPSHOT
                    artifacts, but can also be true for any artifact which is republished without changing it's identifier.
                    By caching artifacts based on their SHA1 checksum, Gradle is able to maintain multiple versions of the same artifact. This means that when resolving against
                    one repository Gradle will never overwrite the cached artifact file from a different repository. This is done without requiring a separate artifact file store per repository.

                <para>
                    The Gradle dependency cache uses file-based locking to ensure that it can safely be used by multiple Gradle processes concurrently. The lock is held whenever the binary
                    meta-data store is being read or written, but is released for slow operations such as downloading remote artifacts.

                <para>The <literal>--offline</literal> command line switch tells Gradle to always use dependency modules from the cache, regardless if they are due to be checked again.
                    When running with offline, Gradle will never attempt to access the network to perform dependency resolution.
                    If required modules are not present in the dependency cache, build execution will fail.</para>

                <para>At times, the Gradle Dependency Cache can be out of sync with the actual state of the configured repositories. Perhaps a repository was initially misconfigured,
                    or perhaps a "non-changing" module was published incorrectly. To refresh all dependencies in the dependency cache, use the <literal>--refresh-dependencies</literal>
                    option on the command line.</para>
                <para>The <literal>--refresh-dependencies</literal> option tells Gradle to ignore all cached entries for resolved modules and artifacts.
                    A fresh resolve will be performed against all configured repositories, with dynamic versions recalculated, modules refreshed, and artifacts downloaded.
                    However, where possible Gradle will attempt to if the previously downloaded artifacts are valid before downloading again.
                    This is done by comparing published SHA1 values in the repository with the SHA1 values for existing downloaded artifacts.</para>

        <para>It is not a big deal to set-up a custom repository.
            <footnote>
                <para>If you want to shield your project from the downtimes of Maven Central things get more complicated. You
                    probably want to set-up a repository proxy for this. In an enterprise environment this is rather
                    common. For an open source project it looks like overkill.
                </para>
            </footnote>
            But it can be tedious, to keep it up to date. For a new version, you have always to create the new XML
            descriptor and the directories. And your custom repository is another infrastructure element which might
            have downtimes and needs to be updated. To enable historical builds, you need to keep all the past
            libraries and you need a backup. It is another layer of indirection. Another source of information
            you have to lookup. All this is not really a big deal but in its sum it has an impact. Repository Manager like
            Artifactory or Nexus make this easier. But for example open source projects don't usually have a host for those products.
        </para>
        <para>This is a reason why some projects prefer to store their libraries in their version control system. This
            approach is fully supported by Gradle. The libraries can be stored in a flat directory without any XML module
            descriptor files.  Yet Gradle offers complete transitive dependency management. You can use either client module
            dependencies to express the dependency relations, or artifact dependencies in case a first level dependency has no
            transitive dependencies. People can check out such a project from svn and have everything necessary to build it.
        </para>
        <para>If you are working with a distributed version control system like Git you probably don't want to
        use the version control system to store libraries as people check out the whole history. But even here the flexibility
        of Gradle can make your life easier. For example you can use a shared flat directory without XML descriptors and
        yet you can have full transitive dependency management as described above.</para>
        <para>You could also have a mixed strategy. If your main concern is bad metadata in the <literal>pom.xml</literal> and maintaining
            custom XML descriptors,
            <emphasis>Client Modules</emphasis>
            offer an alternative. But you can of course still use Maven2 repo and your custom repository as a
            repository for
            <emphasis>jars only</emphasis>
            and still enjoy
            <emphasis>transitive</emphasis>
            dependency management. Or you can only provide client modules for POMs with bad metadata. For the
            jars and the correct POMs you still use the remote repository.

            <title>Implicit transitive dependencies</title>
            <para>There is another way to deal with transitive dependencies
                <emphasis>without</emphasis>
                XML descriptor files. You can do this with Gradle, but we don't recommend it. We mention it for the sake
                of completeness and comparison with other build tools.
            </para>
            <para>The trick is to use only artifact dependencies and group them in lists. That way you have somehow
                expressed, what are your first level dependencies and what are transitive dependencies (see
                <xref linkend="para:notation_collections"/>).
                But the draw-back is, that for the Gradle dependency management all dependencies are considered first level dependencies. The
                dependency reports don't show your real dependency graph and the
                <literal>compile</literal>
                task uses all dependencies, not just the first level dependencies. All in all, your build is less
                maintainable and reliable than it could be when using client modules. And you don't gain anything.
