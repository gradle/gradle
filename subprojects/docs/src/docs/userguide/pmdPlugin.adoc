== The PMD Plugin

The PMD plugin performs quality checks on your project's Java source files using http://pmd.sourceforge.net[PMD] and generates reports from these checks.

[[sec:pmd_usage]]
=== Usage

To use the PMD plugin, include the following in your build script:

++++
<sample id="usePmdPlugin" dir="codeQuality" title="Using the PMD plugin">
    <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="use-pmd-plugin"/>
</sample>
++++

The plugin adds a number of tasks to the project that perform the quality checks. You can execute the checks by running `gradle check`.

Note that Findbugs will run with the same Java version used to run Gradle.
