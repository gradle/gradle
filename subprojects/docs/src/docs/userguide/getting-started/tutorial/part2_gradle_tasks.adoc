= Part 2: Running Gradle Tasks

Learn the basics of Gradle tasks by running one and looking at its output.

****
**In this section you will:**

- See available tasks
- Run a task and inspect the results
- Understand default and typed tasks
- Explore custom tasks
****

[[part2_begin]]
== Step 0. Before you Begin

1. You initialized your Java app in <<part1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>>.

== Step 1. Viewing available Tasks
A _task_ is a basic unit of work that can be done by Gradle as part of the build.

In the `tutorial` directory, enter the command below to list all the available tasks in the project:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew tasks
----

The list includes tasks contributed by the `application` plugin and the plugin it applies:

[source]
----
Application tasks
-----------------
run - Runs this project as a JVM application

Build tasks
-----------
assemble - Assembles the outputs of this project.
build - Assembles and tests this project.

...

Documentation tasks
-------------------
javadoc - Generates Javadoc API documentation for the main source code.

...

Other tasks
-----------
compileJava - Compiles main Java source.

...
----
A task might be responsible for compilation, copying, and moving files around, creating JAR files, generating Javadoc, publishing artifacts to repositories, or many other discrete units of work.

You can also list the tasks only available in the `app` subproject by running `./gradlew :app:tasks`.

TIP: You can obtain more information in the task listing using the `--all` option: `./gradlew tasks --all`.

In <<part1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>> of the tutorial, we ran the `build` task using the `./gradlew build` command.

== Step 2. Understanding Tasks
We've listed the tasks available when the project is initialized.
However, users can create custom tasks that perform some specific work.

Custom task code is typically available in the `build.gradle.kts` file, or it can come as part of a custom plugin. We will learn more about plugins in <<part4_gradle_plugins#part4_begin,part 4>> of the tutorial.

Here is an example `Hello World` task:
[source]
----
tasks.register("welcome"){
    doLast {
        println("Welcome to Gradle")
    }
}
----

This custom task, if added to `build.gradle.kts` file in the `app` subproject directory, would be executed using the command `./gradlew :app:welcome`.

Many times, a task requires another task to run first.
If task B uses the output of task A, then task A must complete before task B begins.

- A task may declare its dependencies explicitly.
- A task may depend on other tasks implicitly.

Here is an example of explicit task dependency:
[source]
----
tasks.register("hello") {
    println('Hello!')
}

tasks.register("greet") {
    println('How are you?')
    dependsOn("hello")
}
----

In this case, `hello` prints before `greet`. The output is `Hello! How are you?`.

Task execution order is automatically determined by Gradle, taking into account explicit and implicit task dependencies.
If there is no dependency between tasks, Gradle enables users to request a specific execution order.

== Step 3. Viewing Tasks in the IDE
Project tasks are also available in IntelliJ.
The project should be open following <<part1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>> of the tutorial.

On the right-hand side of your window, open the `Gradle` pane:

image::tutorial/intellij-idea-tasks.png[]

== Step 4. Running Tasks in the IDE
You can run a Gradle task via IntelliJ by double-clicking that task in the pane.

Double-click **tutorial > app > build > build**.

image::tutorial/intellij-idea-build.png[]

Once the build finishes, make sure it is successful in the IntelliJ console:
[source]
----
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 966ms
7 actionable tasks: 7 executed
3:18:24 AM: Execution finished 'build'.
----

== Step 5. Running Tasks in the Terminal
The `jar` task can be used to create an executable JAR file of the App.

Run the following command in your terminal:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew jar
----

Once the build finishes, an `app.jar` file is created in your `tutorial/app/build/libs/` folder.

Invoke the `run` task and check the output:
[source]
----
$ ./gradlew run

> Task :app:run
Hello World!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 436ms
----

Take a moment and read the Java source code in `tutorial/app/src/main/java/com.gradle.tutorial/App.java`:
[source,java]
----
public class App {
    public String getGreeting() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(new App().getGreeting());
    }
}
----
== Step 6. Understanding Typed Tasks
Gradle tasks are typed.

This example shows a task of type `Copy`:
[source]
----
tasks.register("copyTask",Copy) {
    from("source")
    into("target")
    include("*.war")
}
----

This task copies `*.war` files from the `source` directory to the `target` directory.

Popular tasks types include:

- **Copy** - `Copy` is useful to copy files around.
- **Delete** -  `Delete` is useful to delete files and directories.
- **Exec** - `Exec` is useful to execute arbitrary O/S commands.
- **Zip** - `Zip` is useful to bundle files.

Many more types are included in the link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.api.tasks/-delete/index.html[DSL documentation].

To view a task type, use the command `gradlew help --task <TASK_NAME>`.
