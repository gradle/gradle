    <title>Building native binaries</title>

    <note>
        <para>
            The Gradle support for building native binaries is currently <link linkend="feature_lifecycle">incubating</link>. Please be aware that the DSL and other configuration may change in later Gradle versions.
        </para>
    </note>

    <para>
        The various native binary plugins add support for building native software components from C++, C and Assembler sources.
        While many excellent build tools exist for this space of software development, Gradle offers developers it's trademark power and flexibility
        together with the dependency management practices more traditionally found in the JVM development space.

        <title>Tool chain support</title>
        <para>
            Gradle offers the ability to execute the same build using different tool chains. At present, you control which tool chain will be used to build
            by changing the operating system PATH to include the desired tool chain compiler. The following tool chains are supported:

        <para>
            Currently, there is no direct support for creating multiple variants of the same binary (e.g. 32 bit vs. 64 bit) and there is no direct
            support for cross platform source configuration (à la <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/s/autoconf/">autoconf</ulink>) at this time. Support for different
            compiler chains, managing multiple variants and cross platform source configuration will be added over time, making Gradle a fully capable build tool for C++
            (and other “native” language) projects.

        <title>Component model</title>
        <para>
            A native binary project defines a set of <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.base.Executable"/> and <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.base.Library"/> components,
            each of which Gradle maps to a number of <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.base.NativeBinary"/> outputs.
            For each <literal>executable</literal> or <literal>library</literal> defined, Gradle adds a <apilink class="org.gradle.language.base.FunctionalSourceSet"/> with the same name.
            Each of these functional source sets will contain a language-specific source set for each of the languages supported by the project.
        </para>
        <para>
            To build either a static or shared native library binary,
            a <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.base.Library"/> component is added to the <literal>libraries</literal> container.
            Each <literal>library</literal> component can produce at least one <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.base.SharedLibraryBinary"/>
            and at least one <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.base.StaticLibraryBinary"/>.

        <para>
            To build an executable binary,

        <para>
            For each <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.base.NativeBinary"/> that can be produced by a build,
            a single <literal>lifecycle task</literal> is constructed that can be used to create that binary, together with a set of sub-tasks that do the actual
            work of compiling, linking or assembling the binary.

            <title>Working with shared libraries</title>
            <para>
                For each executable binary produced, the <literal>cpp</literal> plugin provides an <literal>install${binary.name}</literal> task,
                which creates a development install of the executable, along with the shared libraries it requires.
                This allows you to run the executable without needing to install the shared libraries in their final locations.

        <title>Supported Languages: C, C++ and Assembler</title>
        <para>
            Presently, Gradle supports building native binaries from any combination of C++, C and Assembler sources.
            A native binary project will contain one or more named <literal>FunctionalSourceSet</literal> instances (eg 'main', 'test', etc),
            each of which can contain <literal>LanguageSourceSet</literal>s containing C++, C or Assembler source files.
        </para>

        <section>
            <title>C++ support</title>
            <para>
                C++ language support is provided by means of the <literal>'cpp'</literal> plugin.
            </para>
            <sample id="cppPlugin" dir="nativeBinary/cpp" title="The 'cpp' plugin">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="apply-plugin"/>
            </sample>
            <para>
                C++ sources to be included in a native binary are provided via a <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.language.cpp.CppSourceSet"/>,
                which defines a set of C++ source files and optionally a set of exported header files (for a library).
                By default, for any named component the <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.language.cpp.CppSourceSet"/> contains
                <filename>.cpp</filename> source files in <filename>src/${name}/cpp</filename>,
                and header files in <filename>src/${name}/headers</filename>.
            </para>
            <para>
                While the <literal>cpp</literal> plugin defines these default locations for each <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.language.cpp.CppSourceSet"/>,
                it is possible to extend or override these defaults to allow for a different project layout.

            <para>
                For a library named 'main', files in <filename>src/main/headers</filename> are considered the “public” or “exported” headers.
                Header files that should not be exported (but are used internally) should be placed inside the <filename>src/main/cpp</filename> directory (though be aware that
                such header files should always be referenced in a manner relative to the file including them).

            <title>C support</title>

                C sources to be included in a native binary are provided via a <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.language.c.CSourceSet"/>,
                which defines a set of C source files and optionally a set of exported header files (for a library).
                By default, for any named component the <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.language.c.CSourceSet"/> contains
                <filename>.c</filename> source files in <filename>src/${name}/c</filename>,

                Assembler sources to be included in a native binary are provided via a <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.language.asm.AssemblerSourceSet"/>,
                which defines a set of Assembler source files.
                By default, for any named component the <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.language.asm.AssemblerSourceSet"/> contains
                <filename>.s</filename> source files under <filename>src/${name}/asm</filename>.

        <title>Configuring the compiler, assembler and linker</title>
        <para>
            Each binary to be produced is associated with a set of compiler and linker settings, which include command-line arguments as well as macro definitions.
            These settings can be applied to all binaries, an individual binary, or selectively to a group of binaries based on some criteria.
        </para>
        <sample id="allBinarySettings" dir="nativeBinary/cpp" title="Settings that apply to all binaries">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="all-binaries"/>
        </sample>
        <para>
            Each binary is associated with a particular <apilink class="org.gradle.nativecode.base.ToolChain"/>, allowing settings to be targeted based on
            this value.
        </para>
        <para>
            It is easy to apply settings to all binaries of a particular type:
        </para>
        <sample id="allSharedLibraryBinarySettings" dir="nativeBinary/c" title="Settings that apply to all shared libraries">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="all-shared-libraries"/>
        </sample>
        <para>
            Furthermore, it is possible to specify settings that apply to all binaries produces for a particular <literal>executable</literal>
            or <literal>library</literal> component:
        </para>
        <sample id="componentBinarySettings" dir="nativeBinary/assembler" title="Settings that apply to all binaries produced for the 'main' executable component">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="assembler-args"/>
        </sample>
        <para>
            The above example will apply the supplied configuration to all <literal>executable</literal> binaries built.
        </para>
        <para>
            Similarly, settings can be specified to target binaries for a component that are of a particular type:
            eg all <literal>shared libraries</literal> for the <literal>main library</literal> component.
        </para>
        <sample id="sharedLibraryArgs" dir="nativeBinary/cpp-lib" title="Settings that apply only to shared libraries produced for the 'main' library component">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="args"/>
        </sample>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Library Dependencies</title>
        <para>
            Dependencies for C++ projects are binary libraries that export header files. The header files are used during compilation, with the compiled
            binary dependency being used during the linking.
        </para>
        <section>
           <title>Dependencies within the same project</title>
           <para>
               A set of sources may depend on header files provided by another binary component within the same project.
               A common example is a native executable component that uses functions provided by a separate native library component.
           </para>
           <para>
               Such a library dependency can be easily provided to source set associated with the <literal>executable</literal> component:
           </para>
           <sample id="cppSourceLibrary" dir="nativeBinary/cpp" title="Providing a library dependency to the source set">
               <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="source-library"/>
           </sample>
           <para>
               Alternatively, a library dependency can be provided directly to the <literal>ExecutableBinary</literal> for the <literal>executable</literal>.
           </para>

            <title>Project Dependencies</title>
            <para>
                For a component produced in a different Gradle project, the notation is similar.

        <section>
            <title>External Dependencies</title>
            <para>
                External dependencies (i.e. from a repository, not a subproject) are specified using the following syntax:
            </para>
            <sample id="gppArgs" dir="nativeBinary/dependencies" title="Declaring dependencies">
                <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="declaring-dependencies"/>
            </sample>
            <para>
                Each dependency must be specified with the <literal>dependency</literal> method as above and must be declared as part of the source set. The
                <literal>group</literal>, <literal>name</literal> and <literal>version</literal> arguments <emphasis>must</emphasis> be supplied.
            </para>
            <para>
                For each declared dependency, two actual dependencies are created. One with the classifier “<literal>headers</literal>” and extension
                “<literal>zip</literal>” which is a zip file of the exported headers, and another with the classifier “<literal>so</literal>” and extension
                “<literal>so</literal>” which is the compiled library binary to link against (which is supplied as a direct input to the g++ link operation).
            </para>
        </section>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Publishing</title>
        <para>
            The <literal>cpp-exe</literal> and <literal>cpp-lib</literal> plugins configure their respective output binaries to be publishable as part of the
            <literal>archives</literal> configuration. To publish, simply configure the <literal>uploadArchives</literal> task as per usual.
        </para>
        <sample id="cppPublish" dir="nativeBinary/dependencies" title="Uploading exe or lib">
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle" snippet="upload"/>
        </sample>
        <para>
            The <literal>cpp-exe</literal> plugin publishes a single artifact with extension “<literal>exe</literal>”. The <literal>cpp-lib</literal> plugin
            publishes two artifacts; one with classifier “<literal>headers</literal>” and extension “<literal>zip</literal>”, and one with classifier
            “<literal>so</literal>” and extension “<literal>so</literal>” (which is the format used when consuming dependencies).
        </para>
        <note>
            <para>
                Currently, there is no support for publishing the dependencies of artifacts in POM or Ivy files. Future versions will support this.
