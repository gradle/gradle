[[part7_begin]]
== Before you begin

1. You initialized your Java app in <<part1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>>.
2. You ran several tasks in <<part2_gradle_tasks#part2_begin,part 2>>.
3. You learned about dependency management in <<part3_gradle_dep_man#part3_begin,part 3>>.
4. You applied a plugin to your app in <<part4_gradle_plugins#part4_begin,part 4>>.
5. You learned about incremental builds in <<part5_gradle_inc_builds#part5_begin,part 5>>.
6. You turned on the local cache in <<part6_gradle_caching#part6_begin,part 6>>.

== Step 1. Gradle References
To work with Gradle, the following references are useful:

- Gradle API http://gradle.org/docs/current/javadoc/[Javadocs]
- Gradle's https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/index.html[Groovy DSL] or Gradle's https://docs.gradle.org/current/kotlin-dsl/index.html[Kotlin DSL]

To find plugins:

- Gradle <<plugin_reference#plugin_reference,Core Plugins>>
- Gradle link:https://plugins.gradle.org/[Plugin Portal]

To view all Gradle releases:

- https://gradle.org/releases/[Gradle Releases]
