= Writing Build Scripts

In the Gradle Build lifecycle, the initialization phase finds the root project and subprojects included in your <<directory_layout#dir:project_root,project root directory>> using the settings file if it exists.

image::author-gradle-1.png[]

Then, for each project included in the settings file, Gradle creates a `Project()` instance.

Gradle then looks for a corresponding build script file which is used in the configuration phase.

[[tutorial_using_tasks]]
== Build scripts

Every Gradle build is made up of one or more _projects_; a root project and subprojects.

A project typically corresponds to a software component that needs to be built, like a library or an application.
It might represent a library JAR, a web application, or a distribution ZIP assembled from the JARs produced by other projects.

On the other hand, it might represent a thing to be done, such as deploying your application to staging or production environments.

Gradle scripts are written in either Groovy DSL or Kotlin DSL (domain-specific language).

A build script configures a _project_ and is associated with an object of type link:{javadocPath}org/gradle/api/Project.html[`Project`].

As the build script executes, it configures `Project`.

The build script is either a `\*.gradle` file if written in Groovy or a `*.gradle.kts` file when written in Kotlin.

[IMPORTANT]
====
_Build scripts_ define `Project` objects.
====

== Project object

The `Project` object is part of the link:{javadocPath}org/gradle/api/Project.html[Gradle API].

- In the Groovy DSL, the `Project` object documentation is found link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Project.html[here].
- In the Kotlin DSL, the `Project` object documentation is found link:{kotlinDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization/-settings/index.html[here].

Many top-level properties and blocks in a build script are part of the Project API.

For example, the following build script uses the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Project.html#org.gradle.api.Project:name[Project.name] property to print the name of the project:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/projectApi/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=project-name]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/projectApi/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=project-name]"]
----
$ gradle -q check
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/projectApi/tests/projectApi.out[]
----
====

Both `println` statements print out the same property.

The first uses the top-level reference to the `name` property of the `Project` object.
The second statement uses the `project` property available to any build script, which returns the associated `Project` object.

[[sec:standard_project_properties]]
=== Standard project properties

The `Project` object exposes a standard set of properties in your build script.

The following table lists a few commonly used properties:

[%header%autowidth,compact]
|===
| Name | Type | Default Value

| `name`
| `String`
| The name of the project directory.

| `path`
| `String`
| The absolute path of the project.

| `description`
| `String`
| A description for the project.

| `dependencies`
| `DependencyHandler`
| Returns the dependency handler of the project.

| `repositories`
| `RepositoryHandler`
| Returns the repository handler of the project.

| `layout`
| `ProjectLayout`
| Provides access to several important locations for a project.

| `projectDir`
| `File`
| The directory containing the build script.

| `group`
| `Object`
| `unspecified`

| `version`
| `Object`
| `unspecified`
|===

The following table lists a few commonly used methods:

[%autowidth.stretch]
|===
| Name | Description

| `allprojects()`
| Configures this project and each of its subprojects.

| `task()`
| Creates a Task with the given name and adds it to this project.
|===

[[sec:the_script_api]]
== The Script API

When Gradle executes a Groovy build script (`.gradle`), it compiles the script into a class that
implements link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Script.html[Script].

As a result, builds scripts have access to all properties and methods declared by the `Script` interface.

When Gradle executes a Kotlin build script (`.gradle.kts`), it compiles the script into a subclass of link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.kotlin.dsl/-kotlin-project-script-template/index.html[KotlinProjectScriptTemplate].

As a result, builds scripts have access to all visible properties and functions declared by the `KotlinProjectScriptTemplate` type.

== Build script structure

Let's take a look at an example and break it down:

====

=== Add extensions via plugins

Plugins are used to extend Gradle. They are also used to modularize and reuse project configuration.

Plugins can be applied using the `PluginAware.apply(java.util.Map)` method or by using the `PluginDependenciesSpec` plugins script block.

The plugins block is preferred:

[source]
----
plugins {
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm") version "1.9.0"
    application
}
----

In the example, the `application` plugin, which is included with Gradle, has been applied, describing our project as a Java application.

The Kotlin gradle plugin, version 1.9.0 has also been applied.
This plugin is not included with Gradle and therefore has to be described using a `plugin id` and a `plugin version` so that Gradle can find and apply it.

=== Add dependencies and dependency location

A project generally has a number of dependencies it needs in order to do its work.

Those dependencies are grouped in configurations, and can be retrieved and uploaded from repositories.

Use the `DependencyHandler` returned by `Project.getDependencies()` method to manage the dependencies.
Use the `RepositoryHandler` returned by `Project.getRepositories()` method to manage the repositories.

[source]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-test-junit5")
    testImplementation("org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.9.3")
    testRuntimeOnly("org.junit.platform:junit-platform-launcher")
    implementation("com.google.guava:guava:32.1.1-jre")
}
----

=== Use convention properties

A plugin can add properties and method to a project through the project's `Convention` object.

In the example, the `application` plugin added an `application` property which is used to detail the main class of our Java application:

[source]
----
application {
    mainClass.set("main")
}
----

=== Register and configure tasks

Tasks performs some basic piece of work, such as compiling classes, or running unit tests, or zipping up a WAR file.

While tasks are typically defined in plugins, you may need to register or configure tasks in build scripts.

*Registering* a task adds the task to your project.

You can register tasks in a project using the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/TaskContainer.html[`TaskContainer.register(java.lang.String)`] method:

[source]
----
tasks.register<Zip>("zip-reports") {
    from 'Reports/'
    include '*'
    archiveName 'Reports.zip'
    destinationDir(file('/dir'))
}
----

You may have seen usage of the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/TaskContainer.html[`TaskContainer.create(java.lang.String)`] method *which should be avoided*:

[source]
----
tasks.create<Zip>("zip-reports") {
    from 'Reports/'
    include '*'
    archiveName 'Reports.zip'
    destinationDir(file('/dir'))
}
----

TIP: `register`, which enables <<task_configuration_avoidance.adoc#task_configuration_avoidance,task configuration avoidance>>, is preferred over `create`.

You can acquire a reference to a task to configure it using the `TaskCollection.named(java.lang.String)` method:

[source]
----
tasks.named<Test>("test") {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
----

The example below configures the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Javadoc.html[`Javadoc`] task to automatically generate HTML documentation from Java code:

[source]
----
tasks.named("javadoc").configure {
    exclude 'app/Internal*.java'
    exclude 'app/internal/*'
    exclude 'app/internal/*'
}
----

== Build scripting

A build script is made up of zero or more statements and script blocks:

[source]
----
println(project.layout.projectDirectory);
----

Statements can include method calls, property assignments, and local variable definitions:

[source]
----
version = '1.0.0.GA'
----

A script block is a method call which takes a closure as a parameter:

[source]
----
configurations {
}
----

The closure is treated as a configuration closure which configures some delegate object as it executes:

[source]
----
repositories {
    mavenLocal()
}
----

NOTE: `mavenLocal` is a directory on a local machine that stores project artifacts.

A build script is also a Groovy or a Kotlin script:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/upper/kotlin", files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/upper/groovy", files="build.gradle[]"]
----
$ gradle -q upper
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/upper/tests/upper.out[]
----
====

It can contain elements allowed in a Groovy or Kotlin script such as method definitions and class definitions:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/count/kotlin", files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/count/groovy", files="build.gradle[]"]

----
$ gradle -q count
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/count/tests/count.out[]
----
====

[[sec:build_script_external_dependencies]]
=== External dependencies for the build script

NOTE: Instead of manipulating the script classpath directly, it is recommended to <<writing_plugins.adoc#plugins,apply plugins>> that come with their own classpath.
For custom build logic, the recommendation is to <<sharing_build_logic_between_subprojects.adoc#sharing_build_logic_between_subprojects,use a custom plugin>>.

If your build script needs to use external libraries, you can add them to the script's classpath in the build script itself. You do this using the `buildscript()` method, passing in a block which declares the build script classpath.

.Declaring external dependencies for the build script
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/externalDependency/kotlin", files="build.gradle.kts[tags=declare-classpath]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/externalDependency/groovy", files="build.gradle[tags=declare-classpath]"]
====

The block passed to the `buildscript()` method configures a link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/initialization/dsl/ScriptHandler.html[ScriptHandler] instance.
You declare the build script classpath by adding dependencies to the `classpath` configuration.
This is the same way you declare, for example, the Java compilation classpath.
You can use any of the <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#sec:dependency-types,dependency types>> except project dependencies.

Having declared the build script classpath, you can use the classes in your build script as you would any other classes on the classpath. The following example adds to the previous example, and uses classes from the build script classpath.

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/externalDependency/kotlin", files="build.gradle.kts[tags=all]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/externalDependency/groovy", files="build.gradle[tags=all]"]

----
$ gradle -q encode
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/externalDependency/tests/externalBuildDependency.out[]
----
====

For multi-project builds, the dependencies declared with a project's `buildscript()` method are available to the build scripts of all its sub-projects.

Build script dependencies may be Gradle plugins. Please consult <<writing_plugins.adoc#plugins,Using Gradle Plugins>> for more information on Gradle plugins.

NOTE: Gradle instruments the bytecode on the build script classpath to provide backward compatibility and improved usability.
Some libraries may fail integrity self-checks because of this.
In this case, the use of such libraries should be <<configuration_cache#config_cache:requirements:bytecode_modifications_and_isolation,isolated>>.

Every project automatically has a `buildEnvironment` task of type link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.diagnostics.BuildEnvironmentReportTask.html[BuildEnvironmentReportTask] that can be invoked to report on the resolution of the build script dependencies.

[[sec:declaring_variables]]
=== Declare Variables

Build scripts can declare two kinds of variables: local variables and extra properties.

[[sec:local_variables]]
==== Local Variables

[.multi-language-text.lang-kotlin]
Declare local variables with the `val` keyword. Local variables are only visible in the scope where they have been declared. They are a feature of the underlying Kotlin language.

[.multi-language-text.lang-groovy]
Declare local variables with the `def` keyword. Local variables are only visible in the scope where they have been declared. They are a feature of the underlying Groovy language.

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/localVariables/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/localVariables/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]
====

[[sec:extra_properties]]
==== Extra Properties

All of Gradle's enhanced objects, including projects, tasks, and source sets, can hold user-defined properties.

[.multi-language-text.lang-kotlin]
Add, read, and set extra properties via the owning object's `extra` property. Alternatively, you can access extra properties via Kotlin delegated properties using `by extra`.

[.multi-language-text.lang-groovy]
Add, read, and set extra properties via the owning object's `ext` property. Alternatively, you can use an `ext` block to add multiple properties at once.

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/extraProperties/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=extraProperties]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/extraProperties/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=extraProperties]"]

----
$ gradle -q printProperties
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/extraProperties/tests/extraProperties.out[]
----
====

[.multi-language-text.lang-kotlin]
This example adds two extra properties to the `project` object via `by extra`. Additionally, this example adds a property named `purpose` to each source set by setting `extra["purpose"]` to `null`. Once added, you can read and set all of these properties via `extra`.

[.multi-language-text.lang-groovy]
This example adds two extra properties to the `project` object via an `ext` block. Additionally, this example adds a property named `purpose` to each source set by setting `ext.purpose` to `null`. Once added, you can read and set all of these properties just like predefined properties.

Gradle requires special syntax for adding a property so it can fail fast. For example, this allows Gradle to recognize
when a script attempts to set a property that does not exist. You can access extra properties anywhere where you can
access their owning object. This gives extra properties a wider scope than local variables.
Subprojects can access extra properties on their parent projects.

For more information about extra properties, see
link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.plugins.ExtraPropertiesExtension.html[ExtraPropertiesExtension] in the API documentation.

[[sec:configuring_arbitrary_objects]]
=== Configure Arbitrary Objects

The example `configure()` task shows an example of arbitrary object configuration:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/configureObject/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/configureObject/groovy",files="build.gradle[]"]

----
$ gradle -q configure
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/configureObject/tests/configureObject.out[]
----
====

[[sec:configuring_arbitrary_objects_using_an_external_script]]
==== Configure Objects in an External Script

You can also configure arbitrary objects using an external script:

[CAUTION]
.Not supported in Kotlin
====
The Kotlin DSL does not support arbitrary object configuration using an external script.
For more information, see link:https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl/issues/659[gradle/kotlin-dsl#659].
====

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/configureObjectUsingScript/groovy",files="build.gradle[];other.gradle[]"]

----
$ gradle -q configure
include::{snippetsPath}/tutorial/configureObjectUsingScript/tests/configureObjectUsingScript.out[]
----
====

[[sec:closures_as_the_last_parameter_in_a_method]]
=== Last Closure Parameter Syntax

The Gradle DSL uses closures in many places.

When the last parameter of a method is a closure, you can place the closure after the method call:

.Closure as method parameter
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/groovy/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=closureAsLastParam]"]
====

[[sec:closure_delegate]]
==== Closure Delegates

Each closure has a `delegate` object. Groovy uses this delegate to look up variable and method
references to nonlocal variables and closure parameters. Gradle uses this for _configuration closures_,
where the `delegate` object refers to the object being configured.

.Closure delegates
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tutorial/groovy/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=closureDelegates]"]
====

[[script-default-imports]]
=== Default Imports

To make build scripts more concise, Gradle automatically adds a set of import statements to scripts.
As a result, instead of writing `throw new org.gradle.api.tasks.StopExecutionException()`,
you can write `throw new StopExecutionException()` instead.

Gradle implicitly adds the following imports to each script:

.Gradle default imports
[source,groovy]
----
include::default-imports.txt[]
----
