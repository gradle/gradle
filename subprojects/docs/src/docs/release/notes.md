## Potential breaking changes

### Dependency resolution result produces a graph of components instead of a graph of module versions.

* The dependency resolution result is changed so that it produces a graph of components.
* Various interfaces were renamed to reflect this change:
    * `ResolvedModuleVersionResult` to `ResolvedComponentResult`
    * `ModuleVersionSelectionReason` to `ComponentSelectionReason`
    * `ModuleVersionSelectionReasonSerializer` to `ComponentSelectionReasonSerializer`
* Various interface method signatures were changed to return the new component types: `DependencyResult`, `ResolvedComponentResult`, `UnresolvedDependencyResult`, `RenderableDependency` and `DependencyEdge`.
