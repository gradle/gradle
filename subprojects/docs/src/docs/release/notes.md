### Features for easier plugin authoring

While it is easy for a plugin author to extend the Gradle DSL to add top level blocks to the DSL using project extensions, in previous versions of Gradle it was awkward to create a deeply nested DSL inside these top level blocks, often requiring the use of internal Gradle APIs.

In this release of Gradle, API methods have been added to allow a plugin author to create nested DSL elements. See the [example in the user guide](userguide/custom_plugins.html#sec:nested_dsl_elements) section on custom plugins. 

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.
