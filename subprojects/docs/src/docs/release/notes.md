#### Tracking changes in the order of input files

Gradle now recognizes changes in the order of files for classpath properties as a reason to mark a task like `JavaCompile` out-of-date. The new `@OrderSensitive` annotation can be used on task input properties to turn this feature on in custom tasks.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 4.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### Ivy Publish plugin takes into account `transitive` attribute declared for dependencies when generating metadata

Previous versions of Gradle did no reflect `transitive="false"` for a dependency in the generated metadata if the `transitive` attribute was set to `false`. To illustrate the change
in behavior, let's assume the following dependency declaration.

    dependencies {
        compile "commons-dbcp:commons-dbcp:1.4", {
            transitive = false
        }
    }

The generated `ivy.xml` will now properly reflect that the given dependency should not resolve any of its transitive dependencies.

    <dependencies>
        <dependency org="commons-dbcp" name="commons-dbcp" rev="1.4" conf="runtime-&gt;default" transitive="false" />
    </dependencies>

Projects consuming published artifacts generated by the Ivy Publish plugin might experience a different dependency graph than observed with earlier versions of Gradle.

### Maven plugin takes into account `exclude` attributes `group` and `module` for dependencies when generating metadata

Previous versions of Gradle did not add exclusions for dependencies in the generated metadata that either use the attribute `group` _or_ `module`. The following dependency declaration
demonstrates those use cases.

    dependencies {
        compile('org.apache.camel:camel-jackson:2.15.3') {
            exclude group: 'org.apache.camel'
        }
        compile('commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils:1.8.3') {
            exclude module: 'commons-logging'
        }
    }

The generated `pom.xml` will now properly reflect the exclusions in the generated metadata. Projects consuming published artifacts generated by the Maven plugin might
experience a different dependency graph than observed with earlier versions of Gradle.
