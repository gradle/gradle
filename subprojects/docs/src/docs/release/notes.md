## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 4.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

## Potential breaking changes

### BuildInvocations model is always returned for the connected project

In previous Gradle versions, when connected to a sub-project and asking for the `BuildInvocations` model using a `ProjectConnection`,
the `BuildInvocations` model for the root project was returned instead. This violates the contract of `ProjectConnection`. Gradle will now
return the `BuildInvocations` model of the project that the `ProjectConnection` is connected to.
