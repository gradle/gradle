## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 7.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_7.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).


<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

### JVM toolchains improvements

[Java toolchains](userguide/toolchains.html) provide an easy way to declare which Java version your project should be built with.
By default, Gradle will [detect installed JDKs](userguide/toolchains.html#sec:auto_detection) or automatically download new toolchain versions.

#### Checkstyle tasks execute in parallel by default

The [Checkstyle plugin](userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html) now uses the Gradle worker API and JVM toolchains. Checkstyle analysis now runs as an external worker process. Checkstyle tasks may now run in parallel within one project.

In Java projects, Checkstyle will use the same version of Java required by the project. In other types of projects, Checkstyle will use the same version of Java that is used by the Gradle daemon.

### Improved test sources separation in the `eclipse` plugin

The `eclipse` plugin has improved support for [test sources](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.8/jdt.php#jdt-test-sources).
The Eclipse classpath file generated by the plugin has the following changes:

 - Project dependencies defined in test configurations get the `test=true` classpath attribute
 - All source sets and dependencies defined by the JVM Test Suite plugin are also marked as test code by default
 - The `eclipse` plugin DSL exposes properties to configure test sources

```
eclipse {
    classpath {
        testSourceSets = [sourcesSets.test, sourceSets.myTestSourceSet]
        testConfigurations = [configuration.myTestConfiguration]
    }
}
```

Note, that these changes improve the [Buildship](https://eclipse.org/buildship) plugin's project synchronization as well.

See [the documentation](userguide/eclipse_plugin.html#sec:test-sources) for more details.

### Improved Diagnostic Reports for dependency resolution

#### Outgoing Variants

The `outgoingVariants` report has been improved to present information more clearly and consistently:

- New messages when using `--all` and `--variant` options to better describe results (or the lack thereof)
- Classifier printed next to Artifacts if available
- Capabilities, Attributes, Artifacts lists all fully sorted
- Rich Console output coloring improved to highlight important information

See the [OutgoingVariantsReport](dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.diagnostics.OutgoingVariantsReport.html) DSL reference for more details.

#### Resolvable Configurations

There is a new `resolvableConfigurations` report available which will display information about all configurations in a project which can be resolved.  This report compliments `outgoingVariants` and will include the following information:

- Description, Attributes and (directly) extended Configurations
- A `--recursive` option flag can be set to display all configurations which are extended transitively
- Attributes affected by Compatibility or Disambiguation rules during resolution listed
- A `--configuration` option can limit this report to a single configuration
- A `--all` option flag can be set to include legacy configurations which are both resolvable and consumable, these will be hidden by default
-
See the [ResolvableConfigurations](dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.diagnostics.ResolvableConfigurations.html) DSL reference for more details.

#### Dependency Insights

[**TO BE ADDED**]

### Description Available on Secondary Variants

When defining secondary variants, there is a new [ConfigurationVariant](javadoc/org/gradle/api/artifacts/ConfigurationVariant.html#getDescription--) method available to supply a note or description for the variant.
These descriptions will be printed by the `outgoingVariants` report and defaults have been added for existing secondary variants produced by the Java plugin.
### Continuous build is responsive on Windows and macOS

Continuous Build allows you to automatically re-execute the build with the same requested tasks when inputs change.
This allows for continuous feedback during development.

Since Java 9, continuous build did not work very well on Windows and macOS.
It could take up to 10 seconds to pick up a change and trigger a build.

Now, continuous build uses the same infrastructure as Gradle's [file system watching](userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:daemon_watch_fs) to detect changes.
This means that Gradle picks up changes nearly instantly on all platforms and file systems where file system watching is supported.

For more information see the section on [continuous build](userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:continuous_build) in the user manual.

### Query a single property with the `properties` task

The built-in `properties` task prints all project properties to the console. Now, the task takes an optional `--property` argument which configures it to display the selected property only.
```
$ gradle properties --property buildFile

> Task :properties

------------------------------------------------------------
Root project 'example-project'
------------------------------------------------------------

buildFile: /path/to/project/build.gradle

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 550ms
1 actionable task: 1 executed
```

### Support for Java 18

Gradle now supports running on and building with [Java 18](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/18/).

### Support for Groovy 4

Gradle now supports building software using Groovy 4.0.

### Groovydoc exposes more options
The [`Groovydoc`](dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.javadoc.Groovydoc.html) task now exposes more options:

- `access`: for controlling the access levels included in the documentation, defaults to `PROTECTED`
- `includeAuthor`: for controlling whether the author is displayed in the documentation, defaults to `false`
- `processScripts`: for controlling whether scripts are included in the documentation, defaults to `true`
- `includeMainForScripts`: for controlling whether a script's `main` method is included in the documentation, defaults to `true`

These defaults are the same as what was previously used, so there should be no changes to the default behavior.

### --show-version (-V) flag

The `-V` flag (long form `--show-version`) instructs Gradle to first print version information and then continue executing any requested tasks.  This is in contrast to the pre-existing `-v` (long form `--version`) flag which prints version information and then immediately exits.

This flag may be useful in CI enviroments to record Gradle version information in the log as part of a single Gradle execution.

### Run a single PMD task on multiple threads

[PMD](https://pmd.github.io/) is a quality analysis tool that runs on the Java source files of your project.

With this version of Gradle, the [`thread` parameter](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_tools_ant.html#parameters) it offers is now exposed through the PMD extension and tasks.
This allows configuration of PMD to run its analysis on more than one thread.

See the [documentation](userguide/pmd_plugin.html#sec:pmd_conf_threads) for more information.

## Promoted features
Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User Manual section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

- The [TargetJvmEnvironment](javadoc/org/gradle/api/attributes/java/TargetJvmEnvironment.html) interface is now stable.
