To see help contextual to the project, use gradle help

To see more detail about a task, run gradle help --task <task>

To see a list of available tasks, run gradle tasks

USAGE: gradle [option...] [task...]

--configuration-cache-problems     Configures how the configuration cache handles problems (fail or warn). Defaults to fail.
--configure-on-demand              Configure necessary projects only. Gradle will attempt to reduce configuration time for large multi-project builds. [incubating]

--no-daemon                        Do not use the Gradle daemon to run the build. Useful occasionally if you have configured Gradle to always run with the daemon by default.
--export-keys                      Exports the public keys used for dependency verification.
-F, --dependency-verification      Configures the dependency verification mode. Values are 'strict', 'lenient' or 'off'.

-g, --gradle-user-home             Specifies the Gradle user home directory. Defaults to ~/.gradle
-I, --init-script                  Specify an initialization script.

-M, --write-verification-metadata  Generates checksums for dependencies used in the project (comma-separated list)
-m, --dry-run                      Run the builds with all task actions disabled.
--max-workers                      Configure the number of concurrent workers Gradle is allowed to use.
--offline                          Execute the build without accessing network resources.
-P, --project-prop                 Set project property for the build script (e.g. -Pmyprop=myvalue).
-p, --project-dir                  Specifies the start directory for Gradle. Defaults to current directory.
--parallel                         Build projects in parallel. Gradle will attempt to determine the optimal number of executor threads to use.
--no-parallel                      Disables parallel execution to build projects.
--priority                         Specifies the scheduling priority for the Gradle daemon and all processes launched by it. Values are 'normal' (default) or 'low'
--problems-report                  (Experimental) enables HTML problems report

-U, --refresh-dependencies         Refresh the state of dependencies.

--write-locks                      Persists dependency resolution for locked configurations, ignoring existing locking information if it exists
