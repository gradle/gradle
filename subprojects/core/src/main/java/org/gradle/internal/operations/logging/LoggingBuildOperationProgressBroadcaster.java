/**
 * Emits build operation progress for events that represent logging.
 *
 * Uses the existing {@link OutputEventListener} to observe events that <i>may</i> cause console output,
 * and emits build operation progress events for those that do cause console output.
 *
 * Currently, the only audience of these events is the build scan plugin.
 * It is concerned with recreating the <i>plain</i> console for an invocation,
 * and associating logging output with tasks, projects, and other logical entities.
 * It does not attempt to emulate the rich console.
 *
 * This solution has some quirks due to how the console output subsystem in Gradle has evolved.
 *
 * An "output event" effectively represents something of interest happening that
 * some observer may wish to know about in order to visualise what is happening, e.g. a console renderer.
 * We are integrating at this level, but imposing different semantics.
 * We only broadcast the subset of events that influence the "plain console", because this is all we need right now.
 * The build scan infrastructure has some knowledge of how different versions of Gradle respond to these events
 * with regard to console rendering and effectively emulate.
 *
 * Ideally, we would emit a more concrete model.
 * This would be something like more clearly separating logging output from "user code" from Gradle's "UI" output,
 * and separately observing it from rendering instructions.
 * This may come later.
 *
 * @since 4.7
