/**
 * Represents a node in the graph that controls ordinality of destroyers and producers as they are
 * added to the task graph.  For example "clean build" on the command line implies that the user wants
 * to run the clean tasks of each project before the build tasks of each project.  Ordinal nodes ensure
 * this order by tracking the dependencies of destroyers and producers in each group of tasks added to
 * the task graph and prevents producers of a higher ordinality to run before the destroyers of a lower
 * ordinality even if the destroyers are delayed waiting on dependencies (and vice versa).
