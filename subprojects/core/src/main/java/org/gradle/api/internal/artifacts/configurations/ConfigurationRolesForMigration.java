 * from one role to another by marking usages which are present in the current role but not present in the eventual role
 * as deprecated.
 *
 * <p>The roles here are all meant to be temporary roles used for migration only, to be removed in Gradle 9.0.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is meant to only support <strong>narrowing migrations</strong>, that restrict usage that was previously
 * allowed. The migrations should transition from a role defined in {@link ConfigurationRoles} to another
 * role defined in {@link ConfigurationRoles}. This is <strong>not</strong> meant to support general-case
 * migrations from any usage pattern to any other.</p>
