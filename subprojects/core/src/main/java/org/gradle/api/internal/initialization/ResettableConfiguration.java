     * Call this factory (which presumably resolves this Configuration) and then reset the resolution state
     * to the unresolved state, discarding any cached resolution results. No other state is reconfigured.
     * The configuration remains immutable if resolution has already occurred. Any hooks or actions which
     * ran when the configuration was originally resolved may or may not run again if this configuration
     * is resolved again. Any side-effects or external caching which occur as a part of or
     * after this configuration's resolution are not reversed or invalidated.  Note that calling this method
     * will discard the resolution <i>results</i> but will prevent any state required to resolve the
     * configuration again from being discarded.
     * <p>
     * <strong>This method should be avoided if at all possible, and should only be used as a last resort.</strong>
     * This method was originally added in order to release the resources of the {@code classpath}
     * configurations used for resolving buildscript classpaths, as they consumed a non-negligible
     * amount of memory even after the buildscript classpath was assembled.
     * <p>
     * Future work in this area should remove the need of this method by instead caching resolution
     * results to disk and therefore freeing the memory used to cache a configuration's
     * resolution result. This new functionality should be applicable to all configurations -- those
     * used during buildscript classpath loading and normal configuration-time configurations.
     * By applying this functionality to all configurations, this method would no longer be required.
     *
     * @implSpec Usage: This method should only be called on resolvable configurations and should throw an exception if
     * called on a configuration that does not permit this usage.
