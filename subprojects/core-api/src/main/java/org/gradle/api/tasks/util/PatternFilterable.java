/**
 * <p>A {@code PatternFilterable} represents some file container which Ant-style include and exclude patterns or specs
 * can be applied to.</p>
 *
 * <p>Patterns may include:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>'*' to match any number of characters
 *
 * <li>'?' to match any single character
 *
 * <li>'**' to match any number of directories or files
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Either '/' or '\' may be used in a pattern to separate directories. Patterns ending with '/' or '\' will have '**'
 * automatically appended.</p>
 *
 * <p>Examples:</p>
 * <pre>
 * all files ending with 'jsp' (including subdirectories)
 *    **&#47;*.jsp
 *
 * all files beginning with 'template_' in the level1/level2 directory
 *    level1/level2/template_*
 *
 * all files (including subdirectories) beneath src/main/webapp
 *   src/main/webapp/
 *
 * all files beneath any .svn directory (including subdirectories) under src/main/java
 *   src/main/java/**&#47;.svn/**
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>You may also use a closure or {@link Spec} to specify which files to include or exclude. The closure or {@link Spec}
 * is passed a {@link org.gradle.api.file.FileTreeElement}, and must return a boolean value.</p>
 *
 * <p>If no include patterns or specs are specified, then all files in this container will be included. If any include
 * patterns or specs are specified, then a file is included if it matches any of the patterns or specs.</p>
 *
 * <p>If no exclude patterns or spec are specified, then no files will be excluded. If any exclude patterns or specs are
 * specified, then a file is include only if it matches none of the patterns or specs.</p>
