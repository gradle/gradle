/**
 * An attribute container is a container of {@link Attribute attributes}, which are
 * strongly typed named entities. Such a container is responsible for storing and
 * getting attributes in a type safe way. In particular, attributes are strongly typed,
 * meaning that when we get a value from the container, the returned value type is
 * inferred from the type of the attribute. In a way, an attribute container is
 * similar to a {@link java.util.Map} where the entry is a "typed String" and the value
 * is of the string type. However, the set of methods available to the container is
 * much more limited.
 *
 * It is not allowed to have two attributes with the same name but different types in
 * the container.
