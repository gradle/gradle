/**
 * Provides classes, interfaces and annotations for registering and implementing artifact transforms.

 *     To register an artifact transform, use {@link org.gradle.api.artifacts.dsl.DependencyHandler#registerTransform(java.lang.Class, org.gradle.api.Action)}.
 *     This allows you to register a {@link org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformAction} using {@link org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformSpec}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>If you want to create a new artifact transform action, have a look at {@link org.gradle.api.artifacts.transform.TransformAction}.</p>
