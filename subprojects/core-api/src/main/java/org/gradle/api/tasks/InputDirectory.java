/**
 * <p>Marks a property as specifying an input directory for a task.</p>
 *
 * <p>This annotation should be attached to the getter method in Java or the property in Groovy.
 * Annotations on setters or just the field in Java are ignored.</p>
 *
 * <p>This will cause the task to be considered out-of-date when the directory location or contents
 * have changed.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> To make the task dependent on the directory's location but not its
 * contents, expose the path of the directory as an {@link org.gradle.api.tasks.Input} property instead.</p>
