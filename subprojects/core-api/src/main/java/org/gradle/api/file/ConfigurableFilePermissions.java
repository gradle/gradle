     * Sets Unix style permissions. Accept values in two styles of notation:

     *     <li>NUMERIC notation: uses 3 octal (base-8) digits representing permissions for the 3 categories of users; for example "755"</li>
     *     <li>SYMBOLIC notation: uses 3 sets of 3 characters, each set representing the permissions for one of the user categories; for example "rwxr-xr-x"</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The NUMERIC notation consist of 3 digits having values from 0 to 7.
     * 1st digit represents the OWNER, 2nd represents the GROUP while the 3rd represents OTHER users.
     * <p>
     * Each of the digits is the sum of its component bits in the binary numeral system.
     * Each of the 3 bits represents a permission.
     * 1st bit is the READ bit, adds 4 to the digit (binary 100).
     * 2nd bit is the WRITE bit, adds 2 to the digit (binary 010).
     * 3rd bit is the EXECUTE bit, adds 1 to the digit (binary 001).
     * <p>
     * See the examples below.
     * <p>
     * NOTE: providing the 3 numeric digits can also be done in the octal literal form, so "0740" will
     * be handled identically to "740".
     * <p>
     * The SYMBOLIC notation consists of 3 sets of 3 characters. The 1st set represents the OWNER,
     * the 2nd set represents the GROUP, the 3rd set represents OTHER users.
     * <p>
     * Each of the tree characters represents the read, write and execute permissions:
     * <ul>
     *     <li><code>r</code> if READING is permitted, <code>-</code> if it is not; must be 1st in the set</li>
     *     <li><code>w</code> if WRITING is permitted, <code>-</code> if it is not; must be 2nd in the set</li>
     *     <li><code>x</code> if EXECUTING is permitted, <code>-</code> if it is not; must be 3rd in the set</li>
