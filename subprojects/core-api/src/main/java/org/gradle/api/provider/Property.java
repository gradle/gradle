/**
 * A container object that represents a configurable value of a specific type. A {@link Property} is also a
 * {@link Provider} and can be used in the same way as a {@link Provider}. A property's value can be accessed
 * using the methods of {@link Provider} such as {@link Provider#get() get()}. The value can be modified by
 * using the methods {@link #set(Object)} and {@link #set(Provider)}, or their fluid API counterparts
 * {@link #value(Object)} and {@link #value(Provider)}.
 *
 * <p>
 * A property may represent a task output. Such a property carries information about the task producing
 * its value. When this property is attached to an input of another task, Gradle will automatically determine
 * the task dependencies based on this connection.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can create a {@link Property} instance using {@link ObjectFactory#property(Class)}. There are
 * also several specialized subtypes of this interface that can be created using various other factory methods.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances of this interface are not thread-safe for reading and writing.
 * It is not safe to share the same Property instance between different projects.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This interface is not intended for implementation by build script or plugin authors.
 * </p>
