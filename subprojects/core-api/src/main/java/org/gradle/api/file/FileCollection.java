 * <p>A {@code FileCollection} represents a collection of file system locations which you can query in certain ways. A file collection
 * is can be used to define a classpath, or a set of source files, or to add files to an archive.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are no methods on this interface that allow the contents of the collection to be modified. However, there are a number of sub-interfaces, such as {@link ConfigurableFileCollection} that
 * allow changes to be made.</p>
 *
 * <p>A file collection may contain task outputs. The file collection tracks not just a set of files, but also the tasks that produce those files. When a file collection is used as a task input
 * property, Gradle will take care of automatically adding dependencies between the consuming task and the producing tasks.</p>
 *
 * <p>You can obtain a {@code FileCollection} instance using {@link org.gradle.api.Project#files}.</p>
