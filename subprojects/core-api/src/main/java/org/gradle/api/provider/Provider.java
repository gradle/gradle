/**
 * A container object that provides a value of a specific type. The value can be retrieved using one of the query methods
 * such as {@link #get()} or {@link #getOrNull()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * A provider may not always have a value available, for example when the value may not yet be known but will be known
 * at some point in the future. When a value is not available, {@link #isPresent()} returns {@code false} and retrieving
 * the value will fail with an exception.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A provider may not always provide the same value. Although there are no methods on this interface to change the value,
 * the provider implementation may be mutable or use values from some changing source. A provider may also provide a value
 * that is mutable and that changes over time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A provider may represent a task output. Such a provider carries information about the task producing its value. When
 * this provider is attached to an input of another task, Gradle will automatically determine the task dependencies based
 * on this connection.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A typical use of a provider is to pass values from one Gradle model element to another, e.g. from a project extension
 * to a task, or between tasks. Providers also allow expensive computations to be deferred until their value is actually
 * needed, usually at task execution time.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There are a number of ways to create a {@link Provider} instance. Some common methods:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A number of Gradle types, such as {@link Property}, extend {@link Provider} and can be used directly as a provider.</li>
 *     <li>Calling {@link #map(Transformer)} to create a new provider from an existing provider.</li>
 *     <li>Using the return value of {@link org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskContainer#register(String)}, which is a provider that represents the task instance.</li>
 *     <li>Using the methods on {@link org.gradle.api.file.Directory} and {@link org.gradle.api.file.DirectoryProperty} to produce file providers.</li>
 *     <li>By calling {@link ProviderFactory#provider(Callable)} or {@link org.gradle.api.Project#provider(Callable)} to create a new provider from a {@link Callable}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * For a provider whose value can be mutated, see {@link Property} and the methods on {@link org.gradle.api.model.ObjectFactory}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> This interface is not intended for implementation by build script or plugin authors.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2 id="configuration-cache">Configuration Cache</h2>
 * <p>
 * The <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html">Configuration Cache</a> handles providers in a special way.
 * When a provider is discovered to be part of the cached build configuration (e.g. when it is a task input), one of two things happen:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Cache by value</b>.
 *     The value of the provider is computed and stored. This typically happens if the provider is derived from purely configuration-time data.
 *     </li>
 *     <li><b>Cache by computation</b>. The provider is stored as a lazy computation.
 *     For example, if the provider is a result of {@link #map(Transformer)}, then the origin provider (on which {@code map} was called) and
 *     the {@code Transformer} (including its captured variables) are stored. Note that the origin provider may still be cached by value.
 *     After loading from cache, the value is only computed if requested (e.g. with {@link #get()}), as usual.
 *     This typically happens when the value of the provider is only available at execution time (e.g. derived from a task output)
 *     or if it is sourced from the environment (e.g. a system property or an environment variable).
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The Configuration Cache operates under the assumption that most of the stored providers will be used at execution time,
 * so it attempts to cache values of as many providers as possible without introducing more build configuration inputs.
 * However, the exact definition of which provider to cache is intentionally left underspecified.
 * For example, even a provider derived from a system property provider may be cached by value if that system property is already an input.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Following the rules below ensures that your Providers remain configuration-cache compatible regardless of applied optimizations.
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Providers returned by {@link ProviderFactory#provider(Callable)} are always computed at configuration time.
 *     The {@code Callable} may capture arbitrary data types and freely call configuration-time-only APIs.
 *     This is the preferred way to bridge non-lazy and lazy APIs, like passing {@link Project#getVersion()} into task's input {@link Property}.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Any value returned (provided) by the provider must conform to the
 *     <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache_requirements.html#config_cache:requirements">configuration cache requirements</a>.
 *     This requirement may not be enforced when the value is an intermediate result and the Configuration Cache runs the computation chain to cache the end result.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Any value captured by the computation of the provider (e.g. a variable captured by the {@code Transformer} lambda supplied to {@link #map(Transformer)})
 *     must conform to the
 *     <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache_requirements.html#config_cache:requirements">configuration cache requirements</a>.
 *     This requirement may not be enforced when the Configuration Cache runs the computation chain containing non-conforming transformation to cache the end result.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>The computation of the provider (except the {@code Callable} of {@link ProviderFactory#provider(Callable)}) should not invoke configuration-time only APIs.
 *     This requirement may not be enforced when the Configuration Cache runs the computation chain containing non-conforming transformation to cache the end result.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>The computation of the provider should not use external state (read system properties, environment variables, or files) to avoid introducing accidental build configuration inputs.
 *     Preferably, these should be obtained through providers returned by {@link ProviderFactory} and {@link Provider#zip(Provider, BiFunction)} should be used to mix them into the computation chain.
 *     The {@code Callable} of {@link ProviderFactory#provider(Callable)} must ignore this requirement if the external state is used by configuration-time-only API because adding an input is
 *     unavoidable in this case.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Configuration Cache's support of providers that do not conform to these requirements is unspecified.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Some providers returned by Gradle APIs provide types that cannot be configuration-cached, for example {@link TaskProvider} or {@code Provider<Configuration>}.
 * Such providers should not be used as part of the cached build configuration directly,
 * but the providers returned by their {@link #map(Transformer)} or {@link #flatMap(Transformer)} can be if their value or the downstream transformation chain conforms to the requirements above.
 * In most cases it is also safe to add these non-cacheable providers to {@linkplain ConfigurableFileCollection ConfigurableFileCollections} when it makes sense.

     * While very similar in functionality to the regular {@link #map(Transformer) map} operation, this method
     * offers a convenient way of connecting together task inputs and outputs. (For a deeper understanding of

     * Task inputs and outputs often take the form of {@link Provider providers} or {@link Property properties},
     * the latter being a special case of provider whose value can be changed at will. An example of using
     * {@code flatMap} for connecting such properties would be following:
     * </p>
     *
     * <pre><code>
     * class Producer extends DefaultTask {
     *     {@literal @}OutputFile
     *     abstract RegularFileProperty getOutputFile()
     *
     *     //irrelevant details omitted

     *
     * class Consumer extends DefaultTask {
     *     {@literal @}InputFile

     *     //irrelevant details omitted

     *     inputFile = producer.flatMap { it.outputFile }
     * }
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * <p>
     * An added benefit of connecting input and output properties like this is that Gradle can automatically
     * detect task dependencies based on such connections. To make this happen at code level, any task
