     * file only.
     *
     * Note that Gradle will write Maven scopes in the following order:
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li>compile dependencies</li>
     *     <li>runtime dependencies</li>
     *     <li>optional compile dependencies</li>
     *     <li>optional runtime dependencies</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * The mapping only applies to dependencies: dependency constraints will
     * systematically be published as import scope.
     *

     * @param optional true if the dependencies found in this configuration variant should be published as optional
