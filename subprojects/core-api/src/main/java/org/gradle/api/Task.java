/**
 * <p>A <code>Task</code> represents a single atomic piece of work for a build, such as compiling classes or generating
 * javadoc.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each task belongs to a {@link Project}. You can use the various methods on {@link
 * org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskContainer} to create and lookup task instances. For example, {@link
 * org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskContainer#create(String)} creates an empty task with the given name. You can also use the
 * {@code task} keyword in your build file: </p>
 * <pre>
 * task myTask
 * task myTask { configure closure }
 * task myTask(type: SomeType)
 * task myTask(type: SomeType) { configure closure }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Each task has a name, which can be used to refer to the task within its owning project, and a fully qualified
 * path, which is unique across all tasks in all projects. The path is the concatenation of the owning project's path
 * and the task's name. Path elements are separated using the {@value org.gradle.api.Project#PATH_SEPARATOR}
 * character.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Task Actions</h2>
 *
 * <p>A <code>Task</code> is made up of a sequence of {@link Action} objects. When the task is executed, each of the
 * actions is executed in turn, by calling {@link Action#execute}. You can add actions to a task by calling {@link
 * #doFirst(Action)} or {@link #doLast(Action)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Groovy closures can also be used to provide a task action. When the action is executed, the closure is called with
 * the task as parameter.  You can add action closures to a task by calling {@link #doFirst(groovy.lang.Closure)} or
 * {@link #doLast(groovy.lang.Closure)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are 2 special exceptions which a task action can throw to abort execution and continue without failing the
 * build. A task action can abort execution of the action and continue to the next action of the task by throwing a
 * {@link org.gradle.api.tasks.StopActionException}. A task action can abort execution of the task and continue to the
 * next task by throwing a {@link org.gradle.api.tasks.StopExecutionException}. Using these exceptions allows you to
 * have precondition actions which skip execution of the task, or part of the task, if not true.</p>
 *
 * <h2 id="dependencies">Task Dependencies and Task Ordering</h2>
 *
 * <p>A task may have dependencies on other tasks or might be scheduled to always run after another task.
 * Gradle ensures that all task dependencies and ordering rules are honored when executing tasks, so that the task is executed after
 * all of its dependencies and any "must run after" tasks have been executed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Dependencies to a task are controlled using {@link #dependsOn(Object...)} or {@link #setDependsOn(Iterable)},
 * and {@link #mustRunAfter(Object...)}, {@link #setMustRunAfter(Iterable)}, {@link #shouldRunAfter(Object...)} and
 * {@link #setShouldRunAfter(Iterable)} are used to specify ordering between tasks. You can use objects of any of
 * the following types to specify dependencies and ordering:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>A {@code String}, {@code CharSequence} or {@code groovy.lang.GString} task path or name. A relative path is interpreted relative to the task's {@link Project}. This
 * allows you to refer to tasks in other projects. These task references will not cause task creation.</li>
 *
 * <li>A {@link Task}.</li>
 *
 * <li>A {@link TaskDependency} object.</li>
 *
 * <li>A {@link org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskReference} object.</li>
 *
 * <li>A {@link Buildable} object.</li>
 *
 * <li>A {@link org.gradle.api.file.RegularFileProperty} or {@link org.gradle.api.file.DirectoryProperty}.</li>
 *
 * <li>A {@link Provider} object. May contain any of the types listed here.</li>
 *
 * <li>A {@code Iterable}, {@code Collection}, {@code Map} or array. May contain any of the types listed here. The elements of the
 * iterable/collection/map/array are recursively converted to tasks.</li>
 *
 * <li>A {@code Callable}. The {@code call()} method may return any of the types listed here. Its return value is
 * recursively converted to tasks. A {@code null} return value is treated as an empty collection.</li>
 *
 * <li>A Groovy {@code Closure} or Kotlin function. The closure may take a {@code Task} as parameter.
 * The closure or function may return any of the types listed here. Its return value is
 * recursively converted to tasks. A {@code null} return value is treated as an empty collection.</li>
 *
 * <li>Anything else is treated as an error.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Using a Task in a Build File</h2>
 *
 * <h3 id="properties">Dynamic Properties</h3>
 *
 * <p>A {@code Task} has 4 'scopes' for properties. You can access these properties by name from the build file or by
 * calling the {@link #property(String)} method. You can change the value of these properties by calling the {@link #setProperty(String, Object)} method.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>The {@code Task} object itself. This includes any property getters and setters declared by the {@code Task}
 * implementation class.  The properties of this scope are readable or writable based on the presence of the
 * corresponding getter and setter methods.</li>
 *
 * <li>The <em>extensions</em> added to the task by plugins. Each extension is available as a read-only property with the same
 * name as the extension.</li>
 *
 * <li>The <em>convention</em> properties added to the task by plugins. A plugin can add properties and methods to a task through
 * the task's {@link org.gradle.api.plugins.Convention} object.  The properties of this scope may be readable or writable, depending on the convention objects.</li>
 *
 * <li>The <em>extra properties</em> of the task. Each task object maintains a map of additional properties. These
 * are arbitrary name -&gt; value pairs which you can use to dynamically add properties to a task object.  Once defined, the properties
 * of this scope are readable and writable.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h4>Dynamic Methods</h4>
 *
 * <p>A {@link Plugin} may add methods to a {@code Task} using its {@link org.gradle.api.plugins.Convention} object.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Parallel Execution</h3>
 * <p>
 * By default, tasks are not executed in parallel unless a task is waiting on asynchronous work and another task (which
 * is not dependent) is ready to execute.
 *
 * Parallel execution can be enabled by the <code>--parallel</code> flag when the build is initiated.
 * In parallel mode, the tasks of different projects (i.e. in a multi project build) are able to be executed in parallel.
