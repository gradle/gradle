/**
 * Represents an external source of information used by a Gradle build.
 *
 * Examples of external sources include client environment variables,
 * system properties, configuration files, shell commands, network services,
 * among others.
 *
 * <p>
 * Representing external sources as {@link ValueSource}s allows Gradle to transparently manage
 * <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html" target="_top">the configuration cache</a>
 * as values obtained from those sources change.
 * For example, a build might run a different set of tasks depending on whether the {@code CI}
 * environment variable is set or not.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To integrate a new type of value source, create an abstract subclass of this interface
 * and use {@link ProviderFactory#of(Class, Action)} to get a provider to a configured source.
 * The returned {@link org.gradle.api.provider.Provider} can be passed to tasks or queried
 * by build logic during the configuration phase. In the latter case, the source would be automatically
 * considered as an input to the work graph cache.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is possible to have some Gradle services to be <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/service_injection.html#service_injection">injected</a>
 * into the implementation, similar to tasks and plugins.
 * It can be done by adding a parameter to the constructor and annotating the
 * constructor with the {@code @Inject} annotation:
 * <pre>
 * public abstract class MyValueSource implements ValueSource&lt;String, ValueSourceParameters.None&gt; {
 *     private final ExecOperations execOperations;
 *
 *     {@literal @}Inject
 *     public MyValueSource(ExecOperations execOperations) {
 *         this.execOperations = execOperations;
 *     }
 *
 *     {@literal @}Override
 *     {@literal @}Nullable
 *     public String obtain() {
 *         // your custom implementation
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Currently, only a small subset of services is supported:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.process.ExecOperations} provides means to execute external processes.
 *     It is possible to use this service even at configuration time. However, as the
 *     returned value is used to check the configuration cache, the {@link #obtain()} method will
 *     be called during each build. Calling slow commands here will slow things down.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * A value source implementation will most likely take parameters. To do this create a
 * subtype of {@link ValueSourceParameters} and declare this type as the type parameter
 * to the value source implementation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A value source implementation doesn't have to be thread-safe, as the single call
 * to {@link #obtain()} is synchronized.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A value source implementation is exempt from the automatic detection of work graph cache inputs.
 * For example, if the {@link #obtain()} method calls {@code System.getenv("FOO")} then changes to
 * the {@code FOO} environment variable only invalidate the cache if the value returned by the
 * {@code obtain()} method itself changes. The same applies to reading files or system properties.
 * Starting an external process with a standard API (for example, {@code java.lang.ProcessBuilder}) is
 * also allowed.
 * </p>
 *
 * Implementations of ValueSource are subject to the following constraint:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Do not implement {@link #getParameters()} in your class, the method will be implemented by Gradle.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of value obtained from this source.
 * @param <P> The source specific parameter type.
 * @see ProviderFactory#environmentVariable(String)
 * @see ProviderFactory#systemProperty(String)
 * @see ProviderFactory#fileContents(RegularFile)
 * @see ProviderFactory#of(Class, Action)
 * @see <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html">Configuration Cache</a>
