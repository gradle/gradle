/**
 * Interface for services which support recording the "implicit inputs" they generate.
 * Whenever a rule calls a service, it may have side effects that needs to be taken
 * into account when checking if the rule is up-to-date. For example, if a rule performs
 * an HTTP query, we know that there is an implicit input to the rule which is the result
 * of the HTTP query (the external resource).
 *
 * Whenever we need to check if the rule is up-to-date, we must be able to ask the service
 * if the resource is still up-to-date. For this, we need to record calls to the service
 * and their result.
 *
 * In the external resource example, a record may consist of the external resource URI and
 * the external resource text. Then when we need to check if the resource is up-to-date,
 * we can ask the service by calling {@code isUpToDate(IN, OUT)} with
 * the URI as an input.
 *
 * It's up to the service implementation to determine:
 *
 * - the type of the input which allows requesting its up-to-date ness ({@link IN}
 * - the type of the output which allows checking if the result of calling the service is the same ({@link OUT}
 *
 * Both have to be serializable, and it's encouraged to use the minimal footprint which allows
 * determining up-to-date status. For example, a SHA1 of a resource might be enough, rather than storing
 * the whole resource itself.
 *
 * @param <IN> a service specific type, representing a query of the service, which can be replayed later
 * @param <OUT> the fingerprint result of a service query, suitable for checking up-to-date status
 * @param <SERVICE> the type of the service
