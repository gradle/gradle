/**
 * Details about an artifact resolution query. This is used whenever repository
 * content filtering is in place.
 * <p>
 * This interface gives access to the details of the artifact query. There are two
 * cases when filtering can be called:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>when looking for a specific module version, for example org:foo:1.0</li>
 *     <li>when looking for the list of versions for a module, for example org:foo</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Listing is called when using dynamic versions (ranges, 1.+, ...).
 * <p>
 * The module identifier will always be non-null. If what you want to express
 * is that a module cannot be found in a repository, independently of its version,
 * then it's enough to just look at the module id using {@link #getModuleId()}.
 * <p>
 * However, if you have to differentiate depending on the version number (for example,
 * some versions of a module are found in one repository, others in a different repository),
 * then you must look at the version thanks to the {@link #getComponentId()} method. But
 * because there can also be version listings, you must also check for {@link #getModuleId()}.
 * <p>
 * A {@link #isVersionListing() convenience method} makes it easier to find out if you
 * are in the version listing case, or module version case.
 * <p>
 * Filtering is done by calling the {@link #notFound()} method: as soon as you know a module
 * cannot be found in a repository, call this method. Otherwise, Gradle will perform a request
 * to find out. It doesn't matter if the module is eventually not found, as Gradle would handle
 * this appropriately by looking at the next repository: the consequence is just a remote call.
