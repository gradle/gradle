/**
 * State for a component instance (e.g. version of a component) that is used to perform dependency graph resolution and that is independent of the particular
 * graph being resolved.
 *
 * <p>Resolution happens in multiple steps. The first step is to calculate the dependency graph, which involves selecting component instances and one or more variants of each instance.
 * This type exposes only the information and operations required to do this. In particular, it does not expose any information about artifacts unless this is actually required for graph resolution,
 * which only happens in certain specific cases (and something we should deprecate).</p>
 *
 * <p>The subsequent resolution steps to select artifacts, are performed using the instance returned by {@link #prepareForArtifactResolution()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instances of this type are obtained via the methods of {@link org.gradle.internal.resolve.resolver.DependencyToComponentIdResolver} or {@link org.gradle.internal.resolve.resolver.ComponentMetaDataResolver}.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface says nothing about thread safety, however some subtypes may be required to be thread safe.</p>
 *
 * @see ComponentGraphSpecificResolveState for dependency graph specific state for the component.
