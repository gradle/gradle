/**
 * This package contains a hierarchy of {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ResolutionFailure ResolutionFailure}
 * interfaces that exist to categorize types of failure conditions that can occur during dependency resolution and
 * delineate when during dependency resolution a failure occurred.
 * <p>
 * There are currently 4 different categories of resolution failures processed by the
 * {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.ResolutionFailureHandler ResolutionFailureHandler}.  There may be
 * more in the future.
 * <p>
 * These categories are represented by the immediate children of
 * {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ResolutionFailure ResolutionFailure}:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ComponentSelectionFailure}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.VariantSelectionFailure}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.GraphValidationFailure}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ArtifactSelectionFailure}</li>
 * </ol>
 * This list is ordered, as the selection of any given artifact can fail the resolution process in many ways.
 * A failure that occurs in any one category in this list will always have the same information available to it.  If a
 * failure occurs in category ordered below it, fixing the failure can <strong>NOT</strong> result in a different failure
 * in an earlier category, but it may "unblock" a latent failure in a later category.
 * <p>
 * All concrete failures in the {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.type} package should
 * implement exactly one of these interfaces.
