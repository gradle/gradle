/**
 * This class tests that when configurations are used incorrectly - for instance, when a configuration where
 * {@link org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration#isCanBeResolved()} returns {@code false} is resolved - now (as of Gradle 8.0) throw exceptions
 * instead of merely warning.  We want to ensure that the {@code canBeResolved}, {@code canBeConsumed}, and {@code canBeDeclared}
 * flags are set appropriately and consistently on all configurations prior to their usage towards one of these goals.
