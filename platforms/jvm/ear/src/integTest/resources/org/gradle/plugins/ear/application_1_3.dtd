        <!--
        This is the XML DTD for the J2EE 1.3 application deployment
        descriptor.  All J2EE 1.3 application deployment descriptors
        must include a DOCTYPE of the following form:

          <!DOCTYPE application PUBLIC
            "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD J2EE Application 1.3//EN"
            "http://java.sun.com/dtd/application_1_3.dtd">

        -->

        <!--
        The following conventions apply to all J2EE deployment descriptor
        elements unless indicated otherwise.

        - In elements that contain PCDATA, leading and trailing whitespace
          in the data may be ignored.

        - In elements whose value is an "enumerated type", the value is
          case sensitive.

        - In elements that specify a pathname to a file within the same
          JAR file, relative filenames (i.e., those not starting with "/")
          are considered relative to the root of the JAR file's namespace.
          Absolute filenames (i.e., those starting with "/") also specify
          names in the root of the JAR file's namespace.  In general, relative
          names are preferred.  The exception is .war files where absolute
          names are preferred for consistency with the servlet API.

        The application element is the root element of a J2EE application
        deployment descriptor.

        <!--
        The alt-dd element specifies an optional URI to the post-assembly
        version of the deployment descriptor file for a particular J2EE module.
        The URI must specify the full pathname of the deployment descriptor
        file relative to the application's root directory. If alt-dd is not
        specified, the deployer must read the deployment descriptor from the
        default location and file name required by the respective component
        specification.

        The description element is used to provide text describing the parent
        element.  The description element should include any information that
        the application ear file producer wants to provide to the consumer of
        the application ear file (i.e., to the Deployer). Typically, the tools
        used by the application ear file consumer will display the description
        when processing the parent element that contains the description.

        which specifies an optional URI to the post-assembly version of the
        deployment descriptor.

        The application deployment descriptor must have one module element for
        each J2EE module in the application package.
