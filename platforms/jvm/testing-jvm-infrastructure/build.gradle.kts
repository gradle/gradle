            and the conflict resolution rules from capabilities.json ensures this is the version that is resolved.

            This is necessary because the beanshell project migrated coordinates from org.beanshell in version 2.0b4 to org.apache-extras.beanshell
            in version 2.0b5.  We want to resolve version 2.0b6.  The conflict ensures org.apache-extras.beanshell is selected, so we get 2.0b6.  If
            we don't do this, we get 2.0b4, which is not present in our verification-metadata.xml file and causes a build failure.
