#
#   ${applicationName} start up script for POSIX generated by Gradle.
#
#   Important for running:
#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh is
#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or
#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole
#       command line, like:
#
#           ksh ${applicationName}
#
#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script
#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:
#         * functions;
#         * expansions «\$var», «\${var}», «\${var:-default}», «\${var+SET}»,
#           «\${var#prefix}», «\${var%suffix}», and «\$( cmd )»;
#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;
#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».
#
#   Important for patching:
#
#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided
#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.
#
#       The "traditional" practice of packing multiple parameters into a
#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security
#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating
#       options in "\$@", and eventually passing that to Java.
#
#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,
#       and ${optsEnvironmentVar}) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;
#       see the in-line comments for details.
#
#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,
#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.
#
#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template
#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/platforms/jvm/plugins-application/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt
#       within the Gradle project.
#<% /*
#       ... and if you're reading this, this IS the template just mentioned.
#
#       This template is processed by
#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/platforms/jvm/plugins-application/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/UnixStartScriptGenerator.java
#
#       Gradle is a meta-build system used by the project that you're building
#       or installing. It's like autoconf but for projects that are written in
#       Java and related languages. It's also used to build parts of the Gradle
#       project itself.
#
#       The Groovy template language is run in two phases.
#
#        1. Any character following \ is passed unmodified through to the
#           next phase, while the \ is removed. Any other $ followed by
#           varName or {varName} is replaced by the value of that variable.
#
#        2. The result of the first phase is parsed and run in a similar
#           manner to JSP or MASON or PHP: anything within < % ... % > is a
#           code block, anything else is sent as output, subject to the
#           flow imposed by any code segments.
#
#        3. The "output" is a POSIX shell script, which has its own ideas about
#           escaping with backslashes, so to get «\» you need to write «\\\\»
#           and to get «$» you need to write «\\\$».
#
#       For more details about the Groovy Template Engine, see
#       https://docs.groovy-lang.org/next/html/documentation/ section §3.15
#       (Template Engines) for details.
#
#       (An example invocation of this template is from
#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/subprojects/build-init/src/main/java/org/gradle/api/tasks/wrapper/Wrapper.java
#       within the Gradle project, which builds "gradlew".)
