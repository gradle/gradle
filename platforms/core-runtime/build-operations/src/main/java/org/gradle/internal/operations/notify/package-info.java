/**
 * This package forms the basic contract between the build scan plugin
 * and Gradle with regard to observing build operations.
 *
 * It has no dependencies to types outside of this package other than JDK types.
 *
 * Only binary compatible changes, from the caller's perspective,
 * can be made to these types.
 *
 * It can be assumed that only Gradle implements these interfaces,
 * except for {@link org.gradle.internal.operations.notify.BuildOperationNotificationListener}
 * which is implemented by the build scan plugin.
