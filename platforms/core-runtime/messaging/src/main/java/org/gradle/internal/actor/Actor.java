/**
 * <p>An {@code Actor} dispatches method calls to a target object in a thread-safe manner. Methods are called either by
 * calling {@link Dispatch#dispatch(Object)} on the actor, or using the proxy object
 * returned by {@link #getProxy(Class)}. Methods are delivered to the target object in the order they are called on the
 * actor, but are delivered to the target object by a single thread at a time. In this way, the target object does not need
 * to perform any synchronisation.</p>
 *
 * <p>An actor uses one of two modes to deliver method calls to the target object:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Non-blocking, or asynchronous, so that method dispatch does not block waiting for the method call to be delivered or executed.
 * In this mode, the method return value or exception is not delivered back to the dispatcher.
 * </li>
 *
 * <li>Blocking, or synchronous, so that method dispatch blocks until the method call has been delivered and executed. In this mode, the
 * method return value or exception is delivered back to the dispatcher.
 * </li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>All implementations of this interface must be thread-safe.</p>
