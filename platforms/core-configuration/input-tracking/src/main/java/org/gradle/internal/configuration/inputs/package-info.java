/**
 * Configuration input tracking implementation.
 * <p>
 * The build configuration may be influenced by various "environmental" inputs.
 * For example, build logic may read files or access environment variables.
 * Knowing these inputs is important for configuration caching to understand if the cache has to be invalidated when the value of the system property changes.
 * It can also be used to determine undeclared task inputs, and the likes.
