/**
 * The model of an Eclipse resource filter matcher.
 * <p>
 * The matcher decides when the containing filter (or containing matcher) applies.  The
 * matcher configures things like whether this ResourceFilter matches resources by
 * name, project relative path, location, last modified, etc.  Eclipse has many types
 * of built-in matchers and it is possible to specify the id and arguments for custom
 * matchers using this model.
 * <p>
 * A matcher must have an id.  It may have either a custom string argument or a set of nested
 * child matchers (e.g. an 'or' matcher will have several nested condition matchers).
 * <p>
 * For more documentation on usage with examples, see {@link ResourceFilter}.
