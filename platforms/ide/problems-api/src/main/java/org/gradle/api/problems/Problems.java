 * Problems API service.

 * The main purpose of this API is to allow clients to create, configure, and report problems in a centralized way.
 * <p>
 * Reported problems are exposed via build operation progress events, which then are converted to Tooling API progress events.
 * <p>
 * Clients should expect that in future Gradle versions the reported problems will appear in console messages, reports, etc.
