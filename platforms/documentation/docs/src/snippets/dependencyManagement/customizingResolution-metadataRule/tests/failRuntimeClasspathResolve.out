   > Could not resolve org.lwjgl:lwjgl:3.2.3.
     Required by:
         project :
      > The consumer was configured to find a library for use during runtime, compatible with Java 11, packaged as a jar, preferably optimized for standard JVMs, and its dependencies declared externally, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.native.operatingSystem' with value 'windows'. There are several available matching variants of org.lwjgl:lwjgl:3.2.3
        The only attribute distinguishing these variants is 'org.gradle.native.architecture'. Add this attribute to the consumer's configuration to resolve the ambiguity:
          - Value: 'x86-64' selects variant: 'natives-windows-runtime'
          - Value: 'x86' selects variant: 'natives-windows-x86-runtime'
