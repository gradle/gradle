This is not a real IDL file, just a dummy file that is used to demonstrate generated sources from idl inputs.
This file contains a HEADER section and a SOURCE section, which are parsed to generate the actual header and source files.
The generated files have the same name as the idl file, with the extension replaced by '.h' or '.c'.

HEADER <<<
void hello();
>>>
--------------
SOURCE <<<
#include <stdio.h>
#include "hello.h"

void hello () {
  printf("Hello from generated source!!\n");
}
>>>
