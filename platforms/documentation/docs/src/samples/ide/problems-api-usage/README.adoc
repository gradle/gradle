NOTE: You can open this sample in an link:{userManualPath}/gradle_ides.html#gradle_ides[IDE that supports Gradle].

This sample shows how problems can be emitted via the Problems API and how those reports are consumed on the IDE-side.
Visit the user manual to learn more about the link:{userManualPath}/reporting_problems.html#sec:reporting_problems[Problems API].

## Running the sample

To run the sample, execute the `./gradlew :sample-ide:importBuild` command.

## Project structure

The sample consists of multiple, individual builds composed into a composite build with the following layout

* `sample-project`: A Gradle build with plugins that report problems
* `sample-ide`: a project that simulates the IDE functionality. In other words, it uses the Gradle Tooling API to configure and run the `sample-project` build and prints the received problem reports received during the process.
* `reporters/standard-plugin` shows the usage of the Problems API in a standard Gradle plugin.
* `reporters/model-builder-plugin` shows how to use the Problems API to report problems when reading project configuration via the Tooling API.
* `reporters/script-plugin` shows how to use the Problems API in a precompiled script plugin.


## Emitting a problem

Problems can be emitted via an injected `Problems` service.
Here's an example on how to report a problem from a plugin.

====
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="reporters/standard-plugin/src/main/java/reporters/StandardPlugin.java[tags=problems-api-report]"]

## Receiving a problem report

Problems are emitted as Tooling API progress events. They can be processed by registering a `ProgressListener`:
