NOTE: You can open this sample in an link:{userManualPath}/gradle_ides.html#gradle_ides[IDE that supports Gradle].

This sample shows how build logic can be organized into reusable pieces and published to a repository for reuse in other projects
for multi-repo setups.

NOTE: This sample shows how to adopt an link:sample_publishing_convention_plugins.html[existing sample] for use with Test Suites.

IMPORTANT: Test Suites are an link:{userManualPath}/feature_lifecycle.html#sec:incubating_state[incubating] feature, and the details described here may change.

== Use case

As an example, let's say an organization produces two types of Java software - services and libraries.
We want to apply a set of code quality checking rules to both types of projects and configure some aspects specific to each type.


== Organizing build logic

The use case can be modelled by layering three separate plugins:

====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.Build logic layout
[source, kotlin]
----
├── convention-plugins
│   ├── build.gradle.kts
│   ├── settings.gradle.kts
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── main
│   │   │   └── kotlin
│   │   │       ├── com.myorg.java-conventions.gradle.kts
│   │   │       ├── com.myorg.library-conventions.gradle.kts
│   │   │       └── com.myorg.service-conventions.gradle.kts
...
----
=====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.Build logic layout
[source, groovy]
----
├── convention-plugins
│   ├── build.gradle
│   ├── settings.gradle
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── main
│   │   │   └── groovy
│   │   │       ├── com.myorg.java-conventions.gradle
│   │   │       ├── com.myorg.library-conventions.gradle
│   │   │       └── com.myorg.service-conventions.gradle
...
----
=====
====

* `com.myorg.java-conventions` - configures conventions that are generic for any Java project in the organization.
This applies for both types of previously identified software and thus this plugin will be applied in both subsequent plugins.
* `com.myorg.library-conventions` - adds publishing configuration to publish to the organization's repository and configures mandatory documentation checks.
* `com.myorg.service-conventions` - configures integration tests and checks for mandatory content in a README.
Since services differ from libraries, different requirements for documentation are configured in this case.

All plugins created in this sample contain functional tests that use link:{userManualPath}/test_kit.html[TestKit] to verify their behavior.


== Compiling convention plugins

In this sample, convention plugins are implemented as link:{userManualPath}/custom_plugins.html#sec:precompiled_plugins[precompiled script plugins] -
this is the simplest way to start out as you can use one of Gradle's DSLs directly to implement the build logic, just as if the plugin was
a regular build script.

[.multi-language-text.lang-kotlin]
In order for precompiled script plugins to be discovered, the `convention-plugins` project needs to apply the `kotlin-dsl` plugin
in its `build.gradle.kts` file:

[.multi-language-text.lang-groovy]
In order for precompiled script plugins to be discovered, the `convention-plugins` project needs to apply the `groovy-gradle-plugin` plugin
in its `build.gradle` file:

.Enabling precompiled script plugins
====
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="convention-plugins/build.gradle.kts[tags=apply]"]
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="convention-plugins/build.gradle[tags=apply]"]
====

== Publishing convention plugins

In this sample we are targeting a multi-repo setup. In order to apply the above plugins to separate projects, they have to be published
to a company's artifact repository.
Convention plugins are regular Gradle plugins - thus they can be link:{userManualPath}/custom_plugins.html#sec:publishing_your_plugin[published to an external repository like any other Gradle plugin].

Here, we configure the project to publish the plugins using the link:{userManualPath}/publishing_maven.html[maven-publish plugin].
For demonstration purposes, we publish to a local filesystem directory.
You can find information about how to publish to a remote repository in the link:{userManualPath}/publishing_maven.html#publishing_maven:repositories[repositories section of the maven-publish plugin].

.Publishing configuration
====
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="convention-plugins/build.gradle.kts[tags=publish]"]
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="convention-plugins/build.gradle[tags=publish]"]
====

The plugins can be published using:

----
./gradlew publish
----

In order to consume them in another project, configure the plugins repository in the settings file and apply the plugin:
====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.settings.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        maven {
            // replace the path with the actual path to the repository
            url = uri("<path-to>/convention-plugins/build/repo")
        }
    }
}
----
.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
plugins {
    id("com.myorg.service-conventions") version "1.0"
}
----
=====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.settings.gradle
[source, groovy]
----
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        maven {
            // replace the path with the actual path to the repository
            url = uri('<path-to>/convention-plugins/build/repo')
        }
    }
}
----
.build.gradle
[source, groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'com.myorg.service-conventions' version '1.0'
}

== Things to note

=== Applying an external plugin in convention plugin

The `com.myorg.java-conventions` plugin uses the SpotBugs plugin to perform static code analysis.

SpotBugs is an external plugin - external plugins link:{userManualPath}/custom_plugins.html#applying_external_plugins_in_precompiled_script_plugins[need to be added as implementation dependencies] before they can be applied in a convention plugin:
====
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="convention-plugins/build.gradle.kts[tags=repositories-and-dependencies]"]
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="convention-plugins/build.gradle[tags=repositories-and-dependencies]"]
====

* The dependency artifact coordinates (GAV) for a plugin can be different from the plugin id.
* The Gradle Plugin Portal (`gradlePluginPortal()`) is added as a repository for plugin dependencies.
* The plugin version is determined from the dependency version.

Once the dependency is added, the external plugin can be applied in a convention plugin by id:
====
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="convention-plugins/src/main/kotlin/com.myorg.java-conventions.gradle.kts[tags=apply-external-plugin]"]
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="convention-plugins/src/main/groovy/com.myorg.java-conventions.gradle[tags=apply-external-plugin]"]
====

=== Applying other convention plugins

Convention plugins can apply other convention plugins.

The `com.myorg.library-conventions` and `com.myorg.service-conventions` plugins both apply the `com.myorg.java-conventions` plugin:
====
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="convention-plugins/src/main/kotlin/com.myorg.library-conventions.gradle.kts[tags=plugins];convention-plugins/src/main/kotlin/com.myorg.service-conventions.gradle.kts[tags=plugins]"]
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="convention-plugins/src/main/groovy/com.myorg.library-conventions.gradle[tags=plugins];convention-plugins/src/main/groovy/com.myorg.service-conventions.gradle[tags=plugins]"]
====

=== Using classes from the main source set

Convention plugins can use classes defined in the main source set of the plugins project.

In this sample, `com.myorg.service-conventions` plugin uses a custom task class from `src/main/java` to configure service README checks:
====
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="convention-plugins/src/main/kotlin/com.myorg.service-conventions.gradle.kts[tags=use-java-class]"]
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="convention-plugins/src/main/groovy/com.myorg.service-conventions.gradle[tags=use-java-class]"]
====
