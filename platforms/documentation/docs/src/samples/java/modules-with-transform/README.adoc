NOTE: You can open this sample in an link:{userManualPath}/gradle_ides.html#gradle_ides[IDE that supports Gradle].

This sample shows how link:{userManualPath}/artifact_transforms.html[artifact transforms] can be utilised to turn traditional Java libraries into Java Modules by adding additional information to the corresponding Jars.
For that, a plugin called `extra-java-module-info` is defined in the `buildSrc` folder.
This plugin can be copied into another project and adjusted as needed to solve use cases where it is desired to treat every dependency as a Java Module.

The example defines an application that relies on libraries from Maven central where some of them are not available as modules.
It uses `commons-cli` (not a module) to parse the command line arguments, which can contain a JSON String, and `gson` (a proper module) to parse the JSON string.
It also utilises `commons-lang3` (an automatic module) and `commons-beanutils` (not a module) which brings in some additional dependencies that are also not modules.

By configuring our own `extra-java-module-info` plugin, we add information to turn the legacy libraries into modules.

You can run the example application like this:

```
run --args='-json {"message":"Hello","receivers":["Lisa","John"]} -debug'
```
