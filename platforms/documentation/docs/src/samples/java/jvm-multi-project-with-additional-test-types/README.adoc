NOTE: You can open this sample in an link:{userManualPath}/gradle_ides.html#gradle_ides[IDE that supports Gradle].

This sample shows how to add additional test types to a JVM project in Gradle. Your project may have many different kinds of tests--unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, etc. A JVM project in Gradle has a single `Test` task, but other tasks can be added to represent each of these test types.

In this sample, we are testing Java projects with JUnit5; however, this applies to other JVM languages as well.

Concretely, we add a _convention plugin_ in `buildSrc` to share the integration test setup between multiple subprojects:

====
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/myproject.java-conventions.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="buildSrc/src/main/groovy/myproject.java-conventions.gradle[]"]
====

And apply it in an application project:

====
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="application/build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="application/build.gradle[]"]
====

And in library projects:

====
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="utilities/build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="utilities/build.gradle[]"]
====

These additional tests can be executed with the `integrationTest` task or as part of lifecycle `check`:

[listing.terminal.sample-command]
----
$ ./gradlew check
