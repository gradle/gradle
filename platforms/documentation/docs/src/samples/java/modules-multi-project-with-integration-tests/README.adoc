NOTE: You can open this sample in an link:{userManualPath}/gradle_ides.html#gradle_ides[IDE that supports Gradle].

This is an link:sample_java_modules_multi_project.html[extension of this sample] that adds blackbox integration tests.

NOTE: There is also a link:sample_incubating_java_modules_multi_project_with_integration_tests.html[new sample] demonstrating how to use the link:{userManualPath}/feature_lifecycle.html#sec:incubating_state[incubating] link:{userManualPath}/jvm_test_suite_plugin.html[Test Suite Plugin] in this scenario.

Here, we add an additional source set _integrationTest_ with a `module-info.java`.

```
src
└── integrationTest
    └── java
        └── module-info.java
```

We effectively declare a second module that is only used for testing.
The module is `open`, which means that it allows reflective access to its classes at runtime as required by JUnit's test execution engine.

```
open module org.gradle.sample.integtest.utilities {
    requires org.gradle.sample.utilities;
    requires org.junit.jupiter.api;
}
```

NOTE: This sample does **not** work in Eclipse when imported using https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.buildship[Eclipse Buildship].
This is due to https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=520667[a limitation in Eclipse] that does not allow more than one module in one project.
It you want to do blackbox testing in Eclipse, you should move the integration tests to separate subprojects.
