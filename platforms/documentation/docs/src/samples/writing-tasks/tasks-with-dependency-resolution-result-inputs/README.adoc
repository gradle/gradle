This sample shows how to create a plugin with tasks that have dependency resolution results as inputs.
The plugin is packaged via an included build and is demonstrated on a multi-project build for a Java application.

====
include::sample[dir="kotlin",files="settings.gradle.kts[tag=includes];list/build.gradle.kts[];utilities/build.gradle.kts[];build.gradle.kts[]"]
include::sample[dir="groovy",files="settings.gradle[tag=includes];list/build.gradle[];utilities/build.gradle[];build.gradle[]"]
====

To execute the sample tasks:

====
[.testable-sample,dir="groovy"]
=====
[.sample-command]
----
> ./gradlew -q listResolvedArtifacts
include::{samplesPath}/writing-tasks/tasks-with-dependency-resolution-result-inputs/tests/listResolvedArtifacts.out[]
