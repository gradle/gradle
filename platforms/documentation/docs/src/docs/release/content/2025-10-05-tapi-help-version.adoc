= Tooling API: Version info in IDEs

:description: Tooling API adds a model for --version so IDEs can show the exact CLI text without starting a build.

a[href="https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/TBD" target="_blank"](PR TBD)

== Summary

This release adds a small Tooling API model so IDEs and integrations can display the exact output of `gradle --version` without starting a daemon:

- `org.gradle.tooling.model.build.VersionInfo` exposes the version banner text

We also added a convenience accessor on `GradleEnvironment`:

- `getVersionOutput()` returns the same banner text that the CLI prints

Both are additive, marked since 9.3, and adhere to our compatibility guarantees.

== Why it matters

- IDEs can surface Gradle version info instantly, with exact parity to the CLI.
- No daemon spin‑up just to answer “which Gradle am I on?”
- Fewer reasons to shell out to the wrapper, which improves performance and stability on Windows and CI.

== Behavior and compatibility

- Requests for this model do not start a build or a daemon.
- If you ask an older Gradle distribution (< 9.3) for this model, you’ll get the standard unknown model error.
- `BuildEnvironment#getGradle().getVersionOutput()` is present only from 9.3; calling it against older providers throws `UnsupportedMethodException` as usual.

== Impacted APIs (since 9.3)

- New model: `org.gradle.tooling.model.build.VersionInfo`
- Extended: `org.gradle.tooling.model.build.GradleEnvironment#getVersionOutput()`

== Notes for tool authors

- To show the version banner, prefer the `VersionInfo` model. `BuildEnvironment#getGradle().getVersionOutput()` is provided as a convenience when you already fetch `BuildEnvironment`.
- The text matches the CLI exactly, including lines and spacing. Don’t parse it—treat it as display‑only.
- If you support older Gradle, feature‑detect with the Tooling API/Provider version and fall back gracefully.

== Acknowledgments

Thanks to everyone who reviewed the API surface and verified output parity across platforms.
