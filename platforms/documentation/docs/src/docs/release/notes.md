We are excited to announce Gradle @version@ (released [@releaseDate@](https://gradle.org/releases/)).

This release features [1](), [2](), ... [n](), and more.

Gradle 9.0 has many bug fixes and other general improvements. As a major version, this release also has changes to deprecated APIs and behavior. Consult the [Gradle 8.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html) for guidance on removed APIs and behavior.

Be sure to check out the [public roadmap](https://blog.gradle.org/roadmap-announcement) for insight into what's planned for future releases.

## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating the [wrapper](userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) in your project:

```
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@ && ./gradlew wrapper
```

See the [Gradle 8.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes, and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).   

## New features and usability improvements

### Kotlin build script compilation avoidance

With this release, the mechanism for detecting ABI (Application Binary Interface) changes in [Kotlin DSL](userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) (`.kts`) build scripts has been significantly improved. 
Gradle now relies on the Kotlin distribution’s own ABI fingerprinting instead of its previous internal mechanism.

The biggest advantage of the new mechanism is the ability to work in the presence of inline functions, something that Gradle wasn't handling efficiently until now.
This results in substantial performance gains depending on your build and the changes made to the build logic.

For example, in the `gradle/gradle` project, non-ABI changes to build logic now result in up to a 60% reduction in configuration time by avoiding unnecessary script recompilation.

### Kotlin 2 TO DO

### Groovy 4 TO DO

### SemVer TO DO

<a name="config-cache"></a>
### Configuration Cache improvements

Gradle's [Configuration Cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of the configuration phase.
Gradle uses the Configuration Cache to reload a saved configuration when nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### CC TO DO

Check out the link:https://blog.gradle.org/road-to-configuration-cache[blog post] to learn more.

<a name="build-authoring"></a>
### Build authoring improvements

Gradle provides rich APIs for plugin authors and build engineers to develop custom build logic.

#### Gradle API now uses JSpecify Nullability Annotations

Since Gradle 5.0 we've been using annotations from the dormant and unfinished JSR-305 to make the nullness of type usages explicit for the Gradle API.
Starting with Gradle 9.0, the Gradle API is annotated using JSpecify instead.

For more details and potential breakages, see the dedicated [upgrading guide section](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html).

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backward compatibility.
