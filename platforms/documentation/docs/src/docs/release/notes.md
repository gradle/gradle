We would like to thank the following community members for their contributions to this release of Gradle:

Be sure to check out the [public roadmap](https://blog.gradle.org/roadmap-announcement) for insight into what's planned for future releases.

## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating the [Wrapper](userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) in your project:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 8.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes, and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).   

## New features and usability improvements

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the use case or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

### Build authoring improvements

Gradle provides rich APIs for plugin authors and build engineers to develop custom build logic.

#### `DependencyConstraintHandler` now has `addProvider` methods

The [`DependencyConstraintHandler`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/artifacts/dsl/DependencyConstraintHandler.html) now has `addProvider` methods, similar to the 
[`DependencyHandler`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/artifacts/dsl/DependencyHandler.html).

```kotlin
dependencies {
    constraints {
        // Existing API:
        add("implementation", provider { "org.foo:bar:1.0" })
        add("implementation", provider { "org.foo:bar:1.0" }) {
            because("newer versions have bugs")
        }
        // New methods:
        addProvider("implementation", provider { "org.foo:bar:1.0" })
        addProvider("implementation", provider { "org.foo:bar:1.0" }) {
            because("newer versions have bugs")
        }
    }
}
```

This clarifies that adding a provider is possible, and that there is no immediately usable return value. The ability to pass a provider to `DependencyConstraintHandler.add` is unaffected.

## Promoted features
Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backward compatibility.
See the User Manual section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

### Service reference properties are now stable

Service references are task properties meant for easier consumption of [shared build services](userguide/build_services.html#sec:service_references).
[`ServiceReference`](/javadoc/org/gradle/api/services/ServiceReference.html) is now stable.
