```
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@ && ./gradlew wrapper
```

See the [Gradle 8.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes, and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the use case or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

=== Gradle API now uses JSpecify Nullability Annotations

Since Gradle 5.0 we've been using annotations from the dormant and unfinished JSR-305 to make the nullness of type usages explicit for the Gradle API.
Starting with Gradle 9.0, the Gradle API is annotated using JSpecify instead.

For more details and potential breakages, see the dedicated [upgrading guide section](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html).
