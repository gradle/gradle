## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating the [wrapper](userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) in your project:

```text
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@ && ./gradlew wrapper
```

See the [Gradle 9.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_9.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes, and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).   

## New features and usability improvements

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the use case or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

### Testing refactoring
The HTML report generated by the `test` task, `TestReport`, and other `AbstractTestTask` users now provides a more detailed view of the test results.
This is due to a refactoring of the testing infrastructure to use the incubating `TestEventReporter` API internally.
Additionally, the binary output has been adjusted to support non-class-based testing frameworks better.

In the following sections, "suite" refers to specifically the suite features of JUnit 4, JUnit Jupiter, and TestNG.
A general grouping of tests is instead referred to as a "container".

#### Nested test changes
For JUnit 4 and Jupiter, nested test classes are now represented as nested under their enclosing class in the HTML report.
For example, if you had an `OuterClass` with an `InnerClass` nested inside it, it would previously be shown as:
```text
+ OuterClass$InnerClass
|-- someTestMethodInInnerClass
```
It will now be reported in the HTML report as:
```text
+ OuterClass
|-+ InnerClass (or OuterClass$InnerClass for JUnit 4)
  |-- someTestMethodInInnerClass
```
And for multiple inner classes:
```text
+ OuterClass
|-+ InnerClass1 (or OuterClass$InnerClass1 for JUnit 4)
  |-- someTestMethodInInnerClass1
  + InnerClass2 (or OuterClass$InnerClass2 for JUnit 4)
  |-- someTestMethodInInnerClass2
```
In the XML report, nested classes remain the same, emitting `TEST-OuterClass$InnerClass.xml`.

#### Parameterized test changes
Parameterized tests now create a suite that contains all the parameterized test cases for a given method.
For example, if you had a class `TestClass` with two parameterized `paramTest1/2` methods, it would previously be shown as:
```text
+ TestClass
|-- paramTest1[0]
|-- paramTest1[1]
|-- paramTest1[2]
|-- paramTest2[a]
|-- paramTest2[b]
|-- paramTest2[c]
```
It will now be reported in the HTML report as:
```text
+ TestClass
|-+ paramTest1
  |-- paramTest1[0]
  |-- paramTest1[1]
  |-- paramTest1[2]
|-+ paramTest2
  |-- paramTest2[a]
  |-- paramTest2[b]
  |-- paramTest2[c]
```

#### Suite changes
Suites now contain the classes they run, rather than those classes being shown as siblings.
For example, if you had a suite `AllTests` that ran `TestClass1` and `TestClass2`, it would previously be shown as:
```text
+ AllTests
+ TestClass1
|-- someTestMethodInClass1
+ TestClass2
|-- someTestMethodInClass2
```
It will now be reported in the HTML report as:
```text
+ AllTests
|-+ TestClass1
  |-- someTestMethodInClass1
|-+ TestClass2
  |-- someTestMethodInClass2
```
In the XML report, only the class report is emitted now, in `TEST-SomeTestClass.xml`.

#### Package suite changes
Packages are no longer represented as containers in the report for multiple reasons.
First, due to the usage of this report for non-class-based testing, it's currently not possible for Gradle to know if a container is a class,
so synthesizing a package container would be misleading when the container is not a class.
Second, this aligns more closely with how testing frameworks and IDEs group tests.

#### Test standard output / standard error changes
The standard output and standard error (collectively, "output") is no longer combined from each individual test to the container/class level, making it easier to find output relevant to a specific test.
Before and after class output is now associated with the correct class in JUnit 4, JUnit Jupiter, and TestNG (starting with TestNG 6.9.13.3).
Before and after suite/container output is also associated with the correct suite/container for JUnit 4 (starting with JUnit 4.13), JUnit Jupiter, and TestNG (starting with TestNG 6.19.13.3).

### Build authoring improvements

#### New `AttributeContainer.named()` method

This release introduces a new convenience method on `AttributeContainer`, [`named()`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/attributes/AttributeContainer.html#named(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String)), which can create attribute values directly from the container without requiring a separate `ObjectFactory` instance.

This method makes attribute assignment more concise while preserving the same semantics as creating a named value via `ObjectFactory`:

```kotlin
configurations.resolvable("foo") {
    attributes {
        // Before: 
        attribute(Usage.USAGE_ATTRIBUTE, objects.named("red"))
        
        // After:
        attribute(Usage.USAGE_ATTRIBUTE, named("red"))
    }
}
```

### Stream TestKit output

Gradle TestKit's `BuildResult` now offers a new method for accessing the build console output efficiently, especially for builds that produce a large volume of logs.

[`BuildResult.getOutput()`](javadoc/org/gradle/testkit/runner/BuildResult.html#getOutput())
returns a `String` with the full build console output.
This can use large amounts of memory for builds with extensive logs.

A new 
[`BuildResult.getOutputReader()`](javadoc/org/gradle/testkit/runner/BuildResult.html#getOutput())
method is available, returning a `BufferedReader` for streaming the build output incrementally.
This can help reduce memory pressure in TestKit tests.

Please ensure you close the `BufferedReader` after use; we recommend the standard Java try-with-resources pattern for this:

```java
void testProject() {
    BuildResult buildResult = GradleRunner.create()
        .withProjectDir(File("test-project"))
        .withArguments(":build", "--info")
        .build();

    try (BufferedReader outputReader = buildResult.getOutputReader()) {
        List<String> logLines = outputReader.lines()
            .filter(line -> line.contains("example build message"))
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
        // do something with the log lines...
    }
}
```

### Simple console rendering for Problem Reports
The [Problems API](userguide/reporting_problems.html) provides structured feedback on build issues, helping developers and tools like IDEs identify and resolve warnings, errors, or deprecations during configuration or runtime.

Previously, a limitation was that problem reports were not displayed in the console output.
In this release, we've taken a first step toward full console integration.
All problem reports are now rendered in the console output when you configure `--warning-mode=all`.
