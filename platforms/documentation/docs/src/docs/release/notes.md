### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the use case or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

### Core plugin improvements

Gradle provides core plugins for build authors, offering essential tools to simplify project setup and configuration across various languages and platforms.

#### Configuration cache compatibility for Swift and C++ plugins

The [Swift](userguide/swift_application_plugin.html) and [C++](userguide/cpp_application_plugin.html) core plugins are now [configuration cache](userguide/performance.html#enable_configuration_cache) compatible.

The [`xctest`](userguide/xctest_plugin.html) and [`visual-studio`](userguide/visual_studio_plugin.html) plugins are not yet compatible.
