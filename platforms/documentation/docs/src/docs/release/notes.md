## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating the [wrapper](userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) in your project:

```
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@ && ./gradlew wrapper
```

See the [Gradle 8.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes, and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).   

## New features and usability improvements

### Kotlin 2 TO DO

### Groovy 4 TO DO

<a name="config-cache"></a>
### Configuration Cache improvements

Gradle's [Configuration Cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of the configuration phase.
Gradle uses the Configuration Cache to reload a saved configuration when nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### CC TO DO

Check out the link:https://blog.gradle.org/road-to-configuration-cache[blog post] to learn more.

<a name="build-authoring"></a>
### Build authoring improvements

Gradle provides rich APIs for plugin authors and build engineers to develop custom build logic.

#### Gradle API now uses JSpecify Nullability Annotations

Since Gradle 5.0 we've been using annotations from the dormant and unfinished JSR-305 to make the nullness of type usages explicit for the Gradle API.
Starting with Gradle 9.0, the Gradle API is annotated using JSpecify instead.

For more details and potential breakages, see the dedicated [upgrading guide section](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html).

## Promoted features
