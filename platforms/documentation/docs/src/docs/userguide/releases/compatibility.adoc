[[compatibility]]
= Compatibility Matrix

The sections below describe Gradle's compatibility with several integrations.
Versions not listed here may or may not work.

== Java Runtime

Gradle runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is often provided by either a JDK or JRE.
A JVM version between 8 and 23 is required to execute Gradle.
JVM 24 and later versions are not yet supported.

Executing the Gradle daemon with JVM 16 or earlier has been deprecated and will become an error in Gradle 9.0.
The Gradle wrapper, Gradle client, Tooling API client, and TestKit client will remain compatible with JVM 8.

JDK 6 and 7 can be used for <<building_java_projects.adoc#sec:java_cross_compilation,compilation>>.
Testing with JVM 6 and 7 is deprecated and will not be supported in Gradle 9.0.

Any fully supported version of Java can be used for compilation or testing.
However, the latest Java version may only be supported for compilation or testing, not for running Gradle.
Support is achieved using <<toolchains#toolchains,toolchains>> and applies to all tasks supporting toolchains.

See the table below for the Java version supported by a specific Gradle release:
