[[verifying-dependencies]]
= Verifying and Validating Dependencies

Working with external dependencies and plugins from third-party repositories exposes your build to significant supply chain risks.
Dependencies are the most commonly attacked part of the software supply chain, and every artifact you consume, including transitively pulled-in binaries, needs to be both legitimate and unchanged.

To illustrate the risk, consider building an application that uses the `trusty-lib:1.0` library from a public repository.
If an attacker successfully replaces `trusty-lib` in the repository with a malicious version having the same coordinates (`trusty-lib:1.0`), your next build will download the compromised code without any warning.

image::trusty-lib-attack.png[]

To mitigate these risks and avoid integrating compromised artifacts, Gradle provides *dependency verification*.

Dependency verification is, by nature, an inconvenient feature to use: *So why keep it on?*

Because dependency verification is about *trust*: trust that what you download is what you think it is, and that what you ship is what you intended.

Without verification, it is easier for attackers to compromise your supply chain by publishing malicious artifacts under trusted coordinates or by tampering with artifacts in transit or at rest.
Dependency verification helps protect you from these attacks by requiring you to confirm that the artifacts used in your build are the ones you expect.

Finding the right balance between security and convenience is hard, but Gradle provides options to let you choose the right level for your needs.

NOTE: Dependency verification is meant to protect yourself from compromised dependencies, not to prevent you from including _vulnerable_ dependencies.

You can use dependency verification to:

- Detect compromised dependencies
- Detect compromised plugins
- Detect tampered dependencies in the local dependency caches

== Understanding Verification Methods

Gradle provides two complementary mechanisms for dependency verification:

1. *Checksums* – Verify the *integrity* of the artifact (that file contents haven't changed)
2. *Signatures* – Verify the *provenance* of the artifact (who published it)

Used together, they help ensure you get the right library or plugin from a trustworthy author.

[[checksums]]
=== Checksums

A checksum is a short *fingerprint* of a file's contents.

To produce a checksum, the library or plugin file is passed through a cryptographic hash function (for example, `SHA-256`), which returns a fixed-length string that uniquely represents that exact content.
If the file changes in any way, the checksum will also change.

With *checksums*, the build tool keeps a list of expected hashes for each artifact:

* You record the expected checksum (for example, `SHA-256`) of a library or plugin in a trusted file: `gradle/verification-metadata.xml`.
* When the build downloads that artifact, it computes the checksum of the downloaded bytes.
* If the computed checksum doesn't match the expected value, the build fails instead of using the tampered file.

image::checksum-verification.png[]

For example, the checksum entry for `trusty-lib-1.0.jar` might look like this:

[source,xml]
.verification-metadata.xml
----
<artifact name="trusty-lib-1.0.jar">
    <sha256 value="5e87d84077de0c60d9ff4eedbc9fac1506693019eb6f55652afc9e1ff235bd15"/>
</artifact>
----

[[signatures]]
=== Signatures

A signature is a cryptographic *stamp* that proves authenticity.

To produce a signature, the author uses their *private key* to create a digital signature over the library or plugin (typically over its checksum).

With *signatures*, you verify *who* produced the artifact, not just that it hasn't changed:

* The author signs the artifact's checksum using their private key.
* Your build tool trusts a set of public keys.
* When the artifact is downloaded, the build verifies the signature against the trusted public key.
* If the signature is missing, invalid, or signed by an untrusted key, the build fails.

For `trusty-lib-1.0.jar`, a combined checksum and signature entry might look like this:

[source,xml]
.verification-metadata.xml
----
<artifact name="trusty-lib-1.0.jar">
    <sha256 value="5e87d84077de0c60d9ff4eedbc9fac1506693019eb6f55652afc9e1ff235bd15"/>
    <pgp value="D4C89EA4AAF455FD88B22087EFE8086F9E93774E"/>
</artifact>
----

NOTE: The strongest security posture is to use *both* signatures and checksums. Checksums verify *what* you downloaded (content integrity), while signatures verify *who* produced it (publisher authenticity). Use signatures whenever they are available, and fall back to checksums when artifacts are not signed.

[[trusted-keys]]
=== Trusted Keys and Key Servers

Because public keys are part of the verification process, Gradle also records trusted public keys in `verification-metadata.xml` on a group-level basis:

[source,xml]
.verification-metadata.xml
----
<trusted-keys>
    <trusted-key
        id="06D34ED6FF73DE368A772A781063FE98BCECB758"
        group="com.puppycrawl.tools"
        name="checkstyle"/>
</trusted-keys>
----

Public keys are typically fetched from key servers, which are repositories for public keys, such as:

* https://keyserver.ubuntu.com
* https://keys.openpgp.org
* https://pgp.mit.edu

Gradle uses these trusted keys plus the checksum/signature data in `verification-metadata.xml` to ensure that dependencies come from the expected author and have not been tampered with.

[[sub:enabling-verification]]
== Enabling Dependency Verification

[[sub:verification-metadata]]
=== The Verification Metadata File

Dependency verification is automatically enabled as soon as the configuration file is detected.
The file must be located at `$PROJECT_ROOT/gradle/verification-metadata.xml`.

NOTE: Currently, the only source of dependency verification metadata is this XML configuration file. Future versions of Gradle may include other sources (for example, via external services).

A minimal configuration consists of the following:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<verification-metadata xmlns="https://schema.gradle.org/dependency-verification"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="https://schema.gradle.org/dependency-verification https://schema.gradle.org/dependency-verification/dependency-verification-1.3.xsd">
   <configuration>
      <verify-metadata>true</verify-metadata>
      <verify-signatures>false</verify-signatures>
    </configuration>
</verification-metadata>
----

With this configuration, Gradle verifies all artifacts using checksums but will not verify signatures.

Gradle verifies any artifact downloaded via its dependency management engine, including but not limited to:

- Artifact files (e.g., JAR files, ZIPs) used during the build
- Metadata artifacts (POM files, Ivy descriptors, and Gradle Module Metadata)
- Plugins (both project and settings plugins)
- Artifacts resolved via advanced dependency resolution APIs

Gradle does _not_ verify changing dependencies (specifically `SNAPSHOT` versions) or locally produced artifacts (such as JARs generated during the build itself).
By nature, the checksums and signatures of these files change constantly.

WARNING: Using such a minimal configuration file will cause a project with external dependencies or plugins to fail immediately, as the file does not yet contain the required checksums for verification.

[[sec:verification-scope]]
=== Scope of Dependency Verification

The dependency verification configuration is _global_; a single file is used to verify the entire build.
Specifically, the same file applies to all subprojects, the root project, and `buildSrc`.

When using an included build, the following rules apply:

- The configuration file of the _current_ build is used for verification.
- If an included build has its own verification metadata, that configuration is ignored in favor of the _current_ build's settings.
- Much like upgrading a dependency, including a new build may require you to update your _current_ verification metadata.

Because this configuration is global and strict, the most efficient way to begin is by generating a baseline configuration for your existing build.

[[sec:bootstrapping-verification]]
== Bootstrapping and Generating Verification Metadata

IMPORTANT: While Gradle can generate a dependency verification file for you, you should always check whatever Gradle generated because your build may _already_ contain compromised dependencies without you knowing about it.

=== Generating Checksums Only

To enable checksum verification, you need to generate a configuration file based on your current, trusted dependencies.

Run the following command in your terminal:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256
----

What this does:

1. It scans all the dependencies in your project.
2. It calculates the `SHA-256` checksum for each.
3. It creates a file located at `gradle/verification-metadata.xml`.

Gradle supports `MD5`, `SHA1`, `SHA-256`, and `SHA-512` checksums. However, only `SHA-256` and `SHA-512` are considered secure for modern use. `SHA-1` has known collisions and `MD5` should not be used.

=== Generating Checksums and Signatures

To generate both checksums and signatures (recommended when signatures are available), run:

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256,pgp
----

Gradle will:

* Resolve your dependencies.
* Download and/or generate the required verification information.
* Write it in a VCS-friendly XML file at `gradle/verification-metadata.xml`.

The `write-verification-metadata` flag requires the list of checksums that you want to generate or `pgp` for signatures.

Executing this command will cause Gradle to:

* Resolve all resolvable configurations, which includes:
** Configurations from the root project
** Configurations from all subprojects
** Configurations from `buildSrc`
** Included builds configurations
** Configurations used by plugins
* Download all artifacts discovered during resolution
* Compute the requested checksums and possibly verify signatures depending on what you asked
* At the end of the build, generate the configuration file which will contain the inferred _verification metadata_

Gradle only supports verification of signatures published as ASCII-armored PGP files (`.asc`) on remote repositories.
Not all artifacts are published with signatures, and signature verification doesn't guarantee the signatory was legitimate—only that the artifact was signed by a specific key.

=== Example Verification Metadata File

A snippet of the resulting `verification-metadata.xml` looks like this:

[source,xml]
.verification-metadata.xml
----

        </component>

    </components>
</verification-metadata>
----

== Updating Verification Metadata

From this point forward, every time a developer or CI server runs the build, Gradle will compare the downloaded file's checksum against the one stored in this XML file.

When you add a new library or update a version, the build will fail because the new checksum isn't in your XML file yet.

You have two options for updating the verification metadata: auto-update or manual update.

=== Auto-update Verification Metadata

Run the `--write-verification-metadata` command again to append the new hashes:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256
----

Bootstrapping can either be used to create the file from the beginning or to _update_ an existing file with new information.
Therefore, it's recommended to always use the same parameters once you started bootstrapping.

Generation is incremental and preserves existing entries. Gradle-generated checksums will have an `origin` attribute starting with "Generated by Gradle" to indicate they need review.
Manually added entries and header comments are preserved, making it easy to update the file for new dependency versions by regenerating and reviewing the diff.

[source,xml]

         </artifact>
      </component>
    </components>
</verification-metadata>
----

After regenerating the file, follow these steps:

1. *Review the diff* - Check what changed in your version control system.
2. *Remove unnecessary entries* - Delete entries for old dependency versions that are no longer used.
3. *Verify new entries* - Ensure new checksums are correct by checking against official sources when possible.
4. *Handle ignored keys* - If any ignored keys were added, attempt to download them from a keyserver and add them to the keyring if found. See <<#sec:add-ascii-keyring,adding keys to the keyring>>.
5. *Update all "Generated by Gradle" origins* - You must review and update all entries with `origin="Generated by Gradle"`. Common reasons for generation include:
* Artifact is not signed
* PGP signature verification failed
* Key couldn't be downloaded
6. *Change origin to "Verified"* - After verifying the checksum matches, edit the `origin` attribute to `"Verified"` to indicate you've confirmed it.

IMPORTANT: Gradle cannot automatically determine that an entry is outdated. Remove older entries when you upgrade dependencies to keep the file manageable.

WARNING: There are dependencies that Gradle _cannot_ discover automatically. In particular, dependencies that are only resolved during task execution or in custom dependency resolution logic may not be included in the generated file. You may need to add these manually.

=== Manually Update Verification Metadata

Add the new `<component>` entry to the XML file manually with the checksum provided by the library author.

==== Adding Checksums for an Artifact

External components are identified by GAV coordinates (group, artifact name, version), and each artifact by its file name.

For example, to add verification for https://pdfbox.apache.org[Apache PDFBox] with GAV coordinates:

- group: `org.apache.pdfbox`
- name: `pdfbox`
- version: `2.0.17`

Using this dependency triggers the download of two files:

- `pdfbox-2.0.17.jar` - the main artifact
- `pdfbox-2.0.17.pom` - the metadata file

You need to declare checksums for both (unless you <<sec:disabling-metadata-verification,disabled metadata verification>>):

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<verification-metadata xmlns="https://schema.gradle.org/dependency-verification"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="https://schema.gradle.org/dependency-verification https://schema.gradle.org/dependency-verification/dependency-verification-1.3.xsd">

   <components>
      <component group="org.apache.pdfbox" name="pdfbox" version="2.0.17">

            <sha512 value="7e11e54a21c395d461e59552e88b0de0ebaf1bf9d9bcacadf17b240d9bbc29bf6beb8e36896c186fe405d287f5d517b02c89381aa0fcc5e0aa5814e44f0ab331" origin="PDFBox Official site (https://pdfbox.apache.org/download.cgi)"/>
         </artifact>
         <artifact name="pdfbox-2.0.17.pom">
            <sha512 value="82de436b38faf6121d8d2e71dda06e79296fc0f7bc7aba0766728c8d306fd1b0684b5379c18808ca724bf91707277eba81eb4fe19518e99e8f2a56459b79742f" origin="Verified"/>
         </artifact>
      </component>
   </components>
</verification-metadata>
----

===== Where to Get Checksums

Checksums are generally published alongside artifacts on public repositories. However, if a dependency is compromised in a repository, its checksum likely is too.

It's a good practice to get checksums from a different source than where artifacts are hosted—typically the library's official website.
It's much harder to compromise both the repository and the official website simultaneously.

In the example above, the checksum for the JAR was found on the official PDFBox website, while the POM checksum was verified manually. The `origin` attribute documents where the checksum came from, helping others understand how trustworthy the verification is.

===== Using Multiple Checksums

You can declare multiple checksums for the same artifact. Gradle will verify _all_ of them and fail if _any_ verification fails.

[source,xml]
----
<component group="org.apache.pdfbox" name="pdfbox" version="2.0.17">
   <artifact name="pdfbox-2.0.17.jar">
      <md5 value="c713a8e252d0add65e9282b151adf6b4" origin="official site"/>
      <sha1 value="b5c8dff799bd967c70ccae75e6972327ae640d35" origin="official site"/>
   </artifact>
</component>
----

Use multiple checksums when:

* The official site only publishes insecure checksums (MD5, SHA-1). While each can be faked individually, faking multiple checksums for the same artifact is harder.
* You want to add generated checksums alongside manually verified ones for extra validation.
* You're upgrading to more secure checksums but don't want to remove existing ones yet.

===== Handling Transitive Dependencies

Using a dependency like `pdfbox` will bring in transitive dependencies. If your verification file only includes checksums for direct dependencies, the build will fail:

[source,text]
----
Execution failed for task ':compileJava'.
> Dependency verification failed for configuration ':compileClasspath':
    - On artifact commons-logging-1.2.jar (commons-logging:commons-logging:1.2) in repository 'MavenRepo': checksum is missing from verification metadata.
    - On artifact commons-logging-1.2.pom (commons-logging:commons-logging:1.2) in repository 'MavenRepo': checksum is missing from verification metadata.
----

This indicates you need to add checksums for `commons-logging` and all other transitive dependencies.
See <<#sec:troubleshooting-verification>> for more details.

==== Adding Keys for an Artifact

To trust a key for signature verification, add a `pgp` entry to your verification metadata:

[source,xml]
----
<component group="com.github.javaparser" name="javaparser-core" version="3.6.11">
   <artifact name="javaparser-core-3.6.11.jar">
      <pgp value="8756c4f765c9ac3cb6b85d62379ce192d401ab61"/>
   </artifact>
</component>
----

This means you trust `com.github.javaparser:javaparser-core:3.6.11` if it's signed with key `8756c4f765c9ac3cb6b85d62379ce192d401ab61`.

Without trusted keys configured, the build will fail:

[source,text]
----
> Dependency verification failed for configuration ':compileClasspath':
    - On artifact javaparser-core-3.6.11.jar (com.github.javaparser:javaparser-core:3.6.11) in repository 'MavenRepo': Artifact was signed with key '8756c4f765c9ac3cb6b85d62379ce192d401ab61' (Bintray (by JFrog) <****>) and passed verification but the key isn't in your trusted keys list.
----

WARNING: Gradle requires full fingerprint IDs (40 characters, e.g., `b801e2f8ef035068ec1139cc29579f18fa8fd93b`) for `pgp` and `trusted-key` elements, not short or long IDs. This minimizes the risk of collision attacks. For `ignored-key` elements, you can use either fingerprints or long (64-bit) IDs.

NOTE: The key IDs shown in error messages are from the signature file itself. This doesn't necessarily mean you should trust them—if a malicious entity signed the artifact, Gradle won't detect that. Always verify keys against official sources.

== Understanding Signature Verification

Once signature verification is enabled, Gradle follows this workflow for each artifact:

1. Attempts to download the corresponding `.asc` signature file
2. If the signature file exists:
* Automatically downloads the public keys needed for verification
* Verifies the artifact using the downloaded keys
* If signature verification passes, performs any additional checksum verification you configured
3. If the signature file is absent, falls back to checksum verification

This means Gradle's verification is stronger with signatures enabled than with checksums alone:

* If an artifact is signed with multiple keys, all of them must pass validation or the build fails
* If an artifact passes signature verification, any additional checksums configured for that artifact will also be checked

However, passing signature verification doesn't automatically mean you can trust the artifact—you must explicitly trust the keys by adding them to your verification metadata as shown in <<#sec:manual-checking-dependency,Adding Keys for an Artifact>>.

=== Trusting Keys Globally

Signature verification can be simplified by trusting keys at the group level instead of declaring them for each individual artifact. This is useful when the same key signs multiple artifacts from the same publisher.

You can move trusted keys from the artifact level to a global configuration block:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<verification-metadata xmlns="https://schema.gradle.org/dependency-verification"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="https://schema.gradle.org/dependency-verification https://schema.gradle.org/dependency-verification/dependency-verification-1.3.xsd">
   <configuration>
      <verify-metadata>true</verify-metadata>
      <verify-signatures>true</verify-signatures>
      <trusted-keys>
         <trusted-key id="8756c4f765c9ac3cb6b85d62379ce192d401ab61" group="com.github.javaparser"/>
      </trusted-keys>
   </configuration>
   <components/>
</verification-metadata>
----

This configuration trusts any artifact in the `com.github.javaparser` group if it's signed with key `8756c4f765c9ac3cb6b85d62379ce192d401ab61`.

The `trusted-key` element supports these attributes:

* `group` - the group of the artifact to trust
* `name` - the name of the artifact to trust
* `version` - the version of the artifact to trust
* `file` - the name of the artifact file to trust
* `regex` - whether to interpret the other attributes as regular expressions (defaults to `false`)

==== Security Considerations

Be careful when trusting keys globally:

* A valid key may have been used to sign artifact `A` which you trust
* Later, the key could be stolen and used to sign malicious artifact `B`

This means you should limit trust to appropriate groups or artifacts, and avoid trusting keys too broadly.

IMPORTANT: Anyone can put an arbitrary name when generating a PGP key. Never trust a key solely based on its name. Always verify the key is listed on the official project website. For example, Apache projects typically provide a `KEYS.txt` file.

[[sec:verification-dry-mode]]
== Using Dry Mode

By default, bootstrapping is incremental, which means that if you run it multiple times, information is _added_ to the file.
You can rely on your version control system to check the diffs between runs.

There are situations where you want to preview what the generated verification metadata file would look like without actually changing or overwriting the existing one.

To preview changes, add the `--dry-run` flag:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew --write-verification-metadata sha256 help --dry-run
----

Instead of generating the `verification-metadata.xml` file, Gradle will create a new file called `verification-metadata.dryrun.xml` that you can review.

NOTE: Because `--dry-run` doesn't execute tasks, it runs much faster but will miss any dependency resolution that happens at task execution time.

[[sec:disabling-verification]]
== Disabling Metadata Verification

By default, Gradle verifies both artifacts (JARs, ZIPs, etc.) and their metadata files (POM files, Ivy descriptors, Gradle Module Metadata).
Metadata verification can significantly increase the size of your configuration file.

To disable metadata verification, set the `<verify-metadata>` flag to `false`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<verification-metadata xmlns="https://schema.gradle.org/dependency-verification"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="https://schema.gradle.org/dependency-verification https://schema.gradle.org/dependency-verification/dependency-verification-1.3.xsd">
   <configuration>
      <verify-metadata>false</verify-metadata>
      <verify-signatures>false</verify-signatures>
    </configuration>
</verification-metadata>
----

WARNING: Disabling metadata verification reduces security. Compromised metadata files could introduce malicious transitive dependencies into your build.

[[sec:verification-console-output]]
== Configuring the Console Output

By default, if dependency verification fails, Gradle generates a small summary about the verification failure as well as an HTML report containing the full information about the failures.

If your environment prevents you from reading this HTML report file (for example, if you run a build on CI, and it's not easy to fetch the remote artifacts), Gradle provides a way to opt in to a verbose console report.

Add this Gradle property to your `gradle.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
org.gradle.dependency.verification.console=verbose
----

=== Manual Verification of a Dependency

You will likely face a dependency verification failure (either checksum verification or signature verification) and will need to figure out if the dependency has been compromised or not.

In this section we give _an example_ of how you can manually check if a dependency was compromised.

For this we will take this example failure:

[source, text]
----
> Dependency verification failed for configuration ':compileClasspath':
- On artifact j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar (com.google.j2objc:j2objc-annotations:1.1) in repository 'MyCompany Mirror': Artifact was signed with key '29579f18fa8fd93b' but signature didn't match
----

This error message gives us the GAV coordinates of the problematic dependency, as well as an indication of where the dependency was fetched from.
Here, the dependency comes from `MyCompany Mirror`, which is a repository declared in our build.

The first thing to do is therefore to download the artifact and its signature manually from the mirror:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl https://my-company-mirror.com/repo/com/google/j2objc/j2objc-annotations/1.1/j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar --output j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar
$ curl https://my-company-mirror.com/repo/com/google/j2objc/j2objc-annotations/1.1/j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar.asc --output j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar.asc
----

Then we can use the key information provided in the error message to import the key locally:

[source, bash]
----
$ gpg --recv-keys B801E2F8EF035068EC1139CC29579F18FA8FD93B
----

And perform verification:

[source, bash]
----
$ gpg --verify j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar.asc
gpg: assuming signed data in 'j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar'
gpg: Signature made Thu 19 Jan 2017 12:06:51 AM CET
gpg:                using RSA key 29579F18FA8FD93B
gpg: BAD signature from "Tom Ball <****>" [unknown]
----

What this tells us is that the problem is _not_ on the local machine: the repository _already contains a bad signature_.

The next step is to do the same by downloading what is actually on Maven Central:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/j2objc/j2objc-annotations/1.1/j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar  --output central-j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar
$ curl https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/j2objc/j2objc-annotations/1.1/j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar.asc  --output central-j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar.asc
----

And we can now check the signature again:

[source, bash]
----
$ gpg --verify central-j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar.asc

gpg: assuming signed data in 'central-j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar'
gpg: Signature made Thu 19 Jan 2017 12:06:51 AM CET
gpg:                using RSA key 29579F18FA8FD93B
gpg: Good signature from "Tom Ball <****>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: B801 E2F8 EF03 5068 EC11  39CC 2957 9F18 FA8F D93B
----

This indicates that the dependency is _valid_ on Maven Central.
At this stage, we already know that the problem lives in the mirror—it _may_ have been compromised, but we need to verify.

A good idea is to compare the 2 artifacts, which you can do with a tool like https://try.diffoscope.org/[`diffoscope`].

We then figure out that the intent wasn't malicious but that somehow a build has been overwritten with a newer version (the version in Central is newer than the one in our repository).

In this case, you can decide to:

- Ignore the signature for this artifact and trust the different possible checksums (both for the old artifact and the new version)
- Or cleanup your mirror so that it contains the same version as in Maven Central

It's worth noting that if you choose to delete the version from your repository, you will _also_ need to remove it from the local Gradle cache.

This is facilitated by the fact the error message tells you where the file is located:

[source, text]
----
> Dependency verification failed for configuration ':compileClasspath':
    - On artifact j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar (com.google.j2objc:j2objc-annotations:1.1) in repository 'MyCompany Mirror': Artifact was signed with key '29579f18fa8fd93b' but signature didn't match

  This can indicate that a dependency has been compromised. Please carefully verify the signatures and checksums.

  For your information here are the path to the files which failed verification:
    - $GRADLE_USER_HOME/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/com.google.j2objc/j2objc-annotations/1.1/976d8d30bebc251db406f2bdb3eb01962b5685b3/j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar (signature: GRADLE_USER_HOME/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/com.google.j2objc/j2objc-annotations/1.1/82e922e14f57d522de465fd144ec26eb7da44501/j2objc-annotations-1.1.jar.asc)

  GRADLE_USER_HOME = /home/user/.gradle
----

You can safely delete the artifact file as Gradle would automatically re-download it:

[source, bash]
----
rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/com.google.j2objc/j2objc-annotations/1.1
----

=== Handling Wrong Signatures

There are several options when you encounter a signature verification failure:

1. The signature was wrong in the first place, which happens frequently with dependencies published on different repositories.
2. The signature is correct but the artifact has been compromised (either in the local dependency cache or remotely).

The right approach here is to go to the official site of the dependency and see if they publish signatures for their artifacts.
If they do, verify that the signature that Gradle downloaded matches the one published.

NOTE: Artifacts are often signed with expired keys, which is not a problem for verification. Key expiry is meant to prevent signing with stolen keys. If an artifact was signed before the key expired, the signature is still valid.

If you have checked that the dependency is _not_ compromised and that it's "only" the signature which is wrong, you should declare an _artifact level key exclusion_:

[source,xml]
----
   <components>
       <component group="com.github.javaparser" name="javaparser-core" version="3.6.11">
          <artifact name="javaparser-core-3.6.11.pom">
             <ignored-keys>
                <ignored-key id="379ce192d401ab61" reason="internal repo has corrupted POM"/>
             </ignored-keys>
          </artifact>
       </component>
   </components>
----

However, if you only do so, Gradle will still fail because all keys for this artifact will be ignored and you didn't provide a checksum:

[source,xml]
----
   <components>
       <component group="com.github.javaparser" name="javaparser-core" version="3.6.11">
          <artifact name="javaparser-core-3.6.11.pom">
             <ignored-keys>
                <ignored-key id="379ce192d401ab61" reason="internal repo has corrupted POM"/>
             </ignored-keys>
             <sha256 value="a2023504cfd611332177f96358b6f6db26e43d96e8ef4cff59b0f5a2bee3c1e1"/>
          </artifact>
       </component>
   </components>

== Maintaining Verification Metadata

=== Cleaning Up the Verification File

If you do nothing, the dependency verification metadata will grow over time as you add new dependencies or change versions: Gradle will not automatically remove _unused_ entries from this file.
The reason is that there's no way for Gradle to know upfront if a dependency will effectively be used during the build or not.

As a consequence, adding dependencies or changing dependency versions can easily lead to more entries in the file while leaving unnecessary entries.

One option to clean up the file is to move the existing `verification-metadata.xml` file to a different location and call Gradle with the `--dry-run` mode: while not perfect (it will not notice dependencies only resolved at configuration time), it generates _a new file_ that you can compare with the existing one.

We need to move the existing file because both the bootstrapping mode and the dry-run mode are incremental: they copy information from the existing metadata verification file (in particular, trusted keys).

[[sec:refreshing-missing-keys]]
=== Refreshing Missing Keys

Gradle caches missing keys for 24 hours, meaning it will not attempt to re-download the missing keys for 24 hours after failing.

If you want to retry immediately, you can run with the `--refresh-keys` CLI flag:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build --refresh-keys
