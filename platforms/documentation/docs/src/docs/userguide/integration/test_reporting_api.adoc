[[test_reporting_api]]
= Test Reporting API

The Test Reporting API allows you to capture test execution events programmatically and produce results similar to Gradle's built-in `Test` task.
It's particularly useful to integrate non-JVM test results into Gradle's testing infrastructure and publish them in Gradle's HTML test reports.

The API is primarily targeted at plugin developers and platform providers, with the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/tasks/testing/TestEventReporter.html[Javadoc] serving as the main reference.

Let's take a look at a quick example that defines a custom Gradle task, `CustomTest`, which demonstrates how to capture and report test events:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/tasks/customTest/groovy",files="src/main/java/com/example/CustomTest.java[]"]
====

1. The `GroupTestEventReporter` is initialized to act as the root event reporter.
+
It creates directories for test results and reports under the project's build directory:
+
This establishes the reporting hierarchy. *Nesting is supported*.
2. The task uses JUnit Platform to dynamically discover and execute tests, *this would be replaced with your custom test system/platform*.
+
It selects the class `MyTest1` for testing.
+
JUnit’s `Launcher` is used to execute the tests and collect a summary of the results.
3. The `TestEventReporter` is used to record detailed events for each test.
+
For each failure, the test is reported with metadata and marked as failed.
4. Each test group (`junittest`) and the root (`root`) are finalized with success or failure based on the test results.

By using the Test Reporting API:

- **Integration**: Custom tests (even those outside JVM frameworks) can generate events compatible with Gradle's test reporting infrastructure.
- **Rich Metadata**: Developers can attach additional context (e.g., error messages or parent class details) to test events.
- **Consistency**: Results integrate seamlessly with Gradle’s HTML reports, making it easier to debug and understand test outcomes.

For more details on the HTML report itself, see the <<java_testing.adoc#test_reporting,JVM Testing Documentation>>.
