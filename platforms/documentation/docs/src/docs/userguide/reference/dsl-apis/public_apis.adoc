:keywords: public api

Gradle provides many public APIs that allow developers to interact with various build system components.

Any class name containing `Internal`, or that is located in a package containing the segment `.internal.` is by definition not part of the public Gradle API and should not be relied upon for stable usage.

The following table summarizes public Gradle APIs and their common use cases.
This is *not* an exhaustive list:
