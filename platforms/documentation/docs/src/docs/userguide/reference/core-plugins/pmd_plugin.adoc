[[pmd_plugin]]
= The PMD Plugin

The PMD plugin performs quality checks on your project's Java source files using https://pmd.github.io/[PMD] and generates reports from these checks.

[[sec:pmd_usage]]
== Usage

To use the PMD plugin, include the following in your build script:

.Using the PMD plugin
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/codeQuality/codeQuality/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=use-pmd-plugin]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/codeQuality/codeQuality/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=use-pmd-plugin]"]
====

The plugin adds a number of tasks to the project that perform the quality checks. You can execute the checks by running `gradle check`.

Note that PMD will run with the same Java version used to run Gradle.

[[sec:pmd_tasks]]
== Tasks

The PMD plugin adds the following tasks to the project:

`pmdMain` — link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.Pmd.html[Pmd]::
+
Runs PMD against the production Java source files.

`pmdTest` — link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.Pmd.html[Pmd]::
+
Runs PMD against the test Java source files.

The PMD plugin adds the following dependencies to tasks defined by the Java plugin.

.PMD plugin - additional task dependencies
[%header%autowidth,compact]
|===
| Task name | Depends on
| `check`   | All PMD tasks, including `pmdMain` and `pmdTest`.
|===

[[sec:pmd_dependency_management]]
== Dependency management

The PMD plugin adds the following dependency configurations:

.PMD plugin - dependency configurations
[%header%autowidth,compact]
|===
| Name | Meaning
| `pmd` | The PMD libraries to use
| `pmdAux` | The additional libraries that are available for type resolution during analysis. This might be useful if PMD complains about missing classes.
|===

[[sec:pmd_configuration]]
== Configuration

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/codeQuality/codeQuality/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=customize-pmd]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/codeQuality/codeQuality/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=customize-pmd]"]
====

See the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.PmdExtension.html[PmdExtension] class in the API documentation.

[[sec:pmd_conf_threads]]
=== Parallel analysis

You can configure the number of threads to be used by PMD for running its analysis.

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/codeQuality/codeQuality/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=pmd-threads]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/codeQuality/codeQuality/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=pmd-threads]"]
====

[NOTE]
====
This configuration is internal to PMD and is not linked to <<performance#parallel_execution,the number of workers>> used by Gradle.
It means that you have to pay attention to the value entered here and make sure it still makes sense in a multi project build.
This is because parallel Gradle task execution could result in different PMD tasks from different projects running in parallel.
If multiple PMD tasks execute simultaneously in n projects, then up to a maximum of (n * `thread`) PMD threads could run at the same time.
