[[publishing_maven:signing]]
= Signing artifacts

The <<signing_plugin.adoc#signing_plugin, Signing Plugin>> can be used to sign all artifacts and metadata files that make up a publication, including Maven POM files and Ivy module descriptors. In order to use it:

1. Apply the Signing Plugin
2. Configure the <<signing_plugin.adoc#sec:signatory_credentials,signatory credentials>> â€” follow the link to see how
3. Specify the publications you want signed

Here's an example that configures the plugin to sign the `mavenJava` publication:

.Signing a publication
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/signing/maven-publish/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=sign-publication]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/signing/maven-publish/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=sign-publication]"]
====

This will create a `Sign` task for each publication you specify and wire all `publish__PubName__PublicationTo__RepoName__Repository` tasks to depend on it. Thus, publishing any publication will automatically create and publish the signatures for its artifacts and metadata, as you can see from this output:

== Example: Sign and publish a project
