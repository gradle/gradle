[[use_kotlin_dsl]]
== Use Kotlin DSL

Prefer the Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`) over the Groovy DSL (`build.gradle`) when authoring new builds or creating new subprojects in existing builds.

=== Explanation

The Kotlin DSL offers several advantages over the Groovy DSL:

* *Strict typing*: IDEs provide better auto-completion and navigation with the Kotlin DSL.
* *Improved readability*: Code written in Kotlin is often easier to follow and understand.
* *Single-language stack*: Projects that already use Kotlin for production and test code don’t need to introduce Groovy just for the build.

Since Gradle 8.0, link:https://blog.gradle.org/kotlin-dsl-is-now-the-default-for-new-gradle-builds[Kotlin DSL is the default] for new builds created with `gradle init`.
Android Studio also link:https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-kotlin-dsl#timeline[defaults to Kotlin DSL].

[[use_latest_minor_versions]]
== Use the Latest Minor Version of Gradle

Stay on the latest minor version of the major Gradle release you're using, and regularly update your plugins to the latest compatible versions.

=== Explanation

Gradle follows a fairly predictable, time-based release cadence.
Only the latest minor version of the current and previous major release is actively supported.

We recommend the following strategy:

* Try upgrading directly to the latest minor version of your current major Gradle release.
* If that fails, upgrade one minor version at a time to isolate regressions or compatibility issues.

Each new minor version includes:

* Performance and stability improvements.
* Deprecation warnings that help you prepare for the next major release.
* Fixes for known bugs and security vulnerabilities.

Use the `wrapper` task to update your project:

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version <version>
----

You can also install the latest Gradle versions easily using tools like link:https://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN!] or link:https://brew.sh/[Homebrew], depending on your platform.

=== Plugin Compatibility

Always use the latest compatible version of each plugin:

* Upgrade Gradle before plugins.
* Test plugin compatibility using link:https://slack.engineering/shadow-jobs/[shadow jobs].
* Consult changelogs when updating.

Subscribe to the Gradle link:https://newsletter.gradle.org/[newsletter] to stay informed about new Gradle releases, features, and plugins.

[[use_the_plugins_block]]
== Apply Plugins Using the `plugins` Block

You should always use the `plugins` block to <<plugin_basics.adoc#applying_plugins,apply plugins>> in your build scripts.

=== Explanation

The `plugins` block is the preferred way to apply plugins in Gradle.
The plugins API allows Gradle to better manage the loading of plugins and it is both more concise and less error-prone than adding dependencies to the buildscript's classpath explicitly in order to use the `apply` method.

It allows Gradle to optimize the loading and reuse of plugin classes and helps inform tools about the potential properties and values in extensions the plugins will add to the build script.
It is constrained to be idempotent (produce the same result every time) and side effect-free (safe for Gradle to execute at any time).

=== Example

==== Don't Do This

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/usePluginsBlock-avoid/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=avoid-this]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/usePluginsBlock-avoid/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=avoid-this]"]
====

<1> *Declare a Repository*: To use the legacy plugin application syntax, you need to explicitly tell Gradle where to find a plugin.
<2> *Declare a Plugin Dependency*: To use the legacy plugin application syntax with third-party plugins, you need to explicitly tell Gradle the full coordinates of the plugin.
<3> *Apply a Core Plugin*: This is very similar using either method.
<4> *Apply a Third-Party Plugin*: The syntax is the same as for core Gradle plugins, but the version is not present at the point of application in your buildscript.

[[do_not_use_internal_apis]]
== Do Not Use Internal APIs

Do not use APIs from a package where any segment of the package is `internal`, or types that have `Internal` or `Impl` as a suffix in the name.

=== Explanation

Using internal APIs is inherently risky and can cause significant problems during upgrades.
Gradle and many plugins (such as Android Gradle Plugin and Kotlin Gradle Plugin) treat these internal APIs as subject to unannounced breaking changes during any new Gradle release, even during minor releases.
There have been numerous cases where even highly experienced plugin developers have been bitten by their usage of such APIs leading to unexpected breakages for their users.

If you require specific functionality that is missing, it’s best to submit a feature request.
As a temporary workaround consider copying the necessary code into your own codebase and extending a Gradle public type with your own custom implementation using the copied code.

=== Example

==== Don't Do This

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidInternal-avoid/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=avoid-this]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidInternal-avoid/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=avoid-this]"]
====

<1> Casting to `AttributeContainerInternal` and using `toMap()` should be avoided as it relies on an internal API.

[[use_the_gradle_properties_file]]
== Set build flags in `gradle.properties`

Set Gradle build property flags in the `gradle.properties` file.

=== Explanation

Instead of using command-line options or environment variables, set build flags in the root project's `gradle.properties` file.

Gradle comes with a long list of <<build_environment.adoc#sec:gradle_configuration_properties,Gradle properties>>, which have names that begin with `org.gradle` and can be used to configure the behavior of the build tool.
These properties can have a **major impact** on build performance, so it’s important to understand how they work.

You should not rely on supplying these properties via the command-line for every Gradle invocation.
Providing these properties via the command line is intended for short-term testing and debugging purposes, but it’s prone to being forgotten or inconsistently applied across environments.
A permanent, idiomatic location to set and share these properties is in the `gradle.properties` file located in the root project directory.
This file should be added to source control in order to share these properties across different machines and between developers.

You should understand the default values of the properties your build uses and avoid explicitly setting properties to those defaults.
Any change to a property's default value in Gradle will follow the standard <<feature_lifecycle.adoc#backwards_compatibility,deprecation cycle>>, and users will be properly notified.

NOTE: Properties set this way are not inherited across build boundaries when using <<composite_builds.adoc#composite_builds,composite builds>>.

=== Example

==== Don't Do This

====

This build is run with `gradle run -Dorg.gradle.continue=true`, so that the failure of the `first` task does **not** prevent the `second` task from executing.

This relies on person running the build to remember to set this property, which is error prone and not portable across different machines and environments.

[[favor_composite_builds]]
== Favor `build-logic` Composite Builds for Build Logic
:keywords: structuring-builds,composite-builds,buildSrc

You should setup a <<composite_builds.adoc#defining_composite_builds,Composite Build>> (often called an "included build") to hold your build logic—including any custom plugins, convention plugins, and other build-specific customizations.

=== Explanation

The preferred location for build logic is an included build (typically named `build-logic`), **not** in `buildSrc`.

The automatically available `buildSrc` is great for rapid prototyping, but it comes with some subtle disadvantages:

* There are classloader differences in how these 2 approaches behave that can be surprising; included builds are treated just like external dependencies, which is a simpler mental model.  Dependency resolution behaves subtly differently in `buildSrc`.
* There can potentially be fewer task invalidations in a build when files in an included build are modified, leading to faster builds.  Any change in `buildSrc` causes the entire build to become out-of-date, whereas changes in a subproject of an included build only cause projects in the build using the products of that particular subproject to be out-of-date.
* Included builds are complete Gradle builds and can be opened, worked on, and built independently as standalone projects.  It is straightforward to publish their products, including plugins, in order to share them with other projects.
* The `buildSrc` project automatically applies the `java` plugin, which may be unnecessary.

One important caveat to this recommendation is when creating `Settings` plugins.
Defining these in a `build-logic` project requires it to be included in the `pluginManagement` block of the main build's `settings.gradle(.kts)` file, in order to make these plugins available to the build early enough to be applied to the `Settings` instance.
This is possible, but reduces Build Caching capability, potentially impacting performance.
A better solution is to use a separate, minimal, included build (e.g. `build-logic-settings`) to hold only `Settings` plugins.

Another potential reason to use `buildSrc` is if you have a very large number of subprojects within your included `build-logic`.
Applying a different set of `build-logic` plugins to the subprojects in your _including_ build will result in a different classpath being used for each.
This may have performance implications and make your build harder to understand.
Using different plugin combinations can cause features like <<build_services.adoc#build_services,Build Services>> to break in difficult to diagnose ways.

Ideally, there would be no difference between using `buildSrc` and an included build, as `buildSrc` is intended to behave like an implicitly available included build.
However, due to historical reasons, these subtle differences still exist.
As this changes, this recommendation may be revised in the future.
For now, these differences can introduce confusion.

Since setting up a composite build requires only minimal additional configuration, we recommend using it over `buildSrc` in most cases.

[[avoid_empty_projects]]
== Avoid Unintentionally Creating Empty Projects
:keywords: structuring-builds

When using a hierarchical directory structure to organize your Gradle projects, make sure to avoid unintentionally creating empty projects in your build.

=== Explanation

When you use the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html#org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings:include(java.lang.Iterable)[Settings.include()] method to include a project in your Grade settings file, you typically include projects by supplying the directory name like `include("featureA")`.
This usage assumes that `featureA` is located at the root of your build.

You can also include projects located in subdirectories using hierarchical paths with the `:` charactor as a separator.
This allows you to organize large builds containing many projects to improve comprehensibility, versus having all your projects live at the root of the build.
For instance, if project `search` was located in a subdirectory named `features`, itself located in a subdirectory named `subs`, you could call `include(":subs:features:search")` to include it.

However, without further configuration, Gradle will create empty projects for every element of the path.
In the example above, Gradle will create a project named `:subs`, a project named `:subs:features`, and a project named `:subs:features:search`.
This probably isn't intended, as you likely only want to include the `search` project.
Additional projects - even if empty - will slow down your build, clutter reporting, and make your build harder to understand.

To avoid this, be sure to explicitly set the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.Project.html#org.gradle.api.Project:projectDir[Project.projectDir] property of any projects included in nested directories: `project(':my-web-module').projectDir = file("subs/web/my-web-module"`).

As ab added benefit, this will allow you to reference the project by the shorter name `:my-web-module` instead of the full logical path `:subs:web:my-web-module`.

include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidEmptyProjects-do/tests",files="avoidEmptyProjects-do.out"]
====

The output of running the `projects` report on the above build shows that now Gradle only creates the intended projects for this build.

You can also now invoke tasks on the `my-web-module` project using the shorter name `:my-web-module` like `gradle :my-web-module:build`, instead of `gradle :subs:web:my-web-module:build`.
