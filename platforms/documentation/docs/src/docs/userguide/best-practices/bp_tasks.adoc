= Best Practices for Tasks

== Avoid DependsOn

The task link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/DefaultTask.html#setDependsOn(java.lang.Iterable)[dependsOn] method should only be used for <<organizing_tasks.adoc#sec:lifecycle_tasks,lifecycle tasks>> (tasks without task actions).

=== Explanation
Tasks with actions should declare their inputs and outputs so that Gradleâ€™s up-to-date checking can automatically determine when these tasks need to be run or rerun.

Using `dependsOn` to link tasks is a much coarser-grained mechanism that does **not** allow Gradle to understand why a task requires a prerequisite task to run, or which specific files from a prerequisite task are needed.
`dependsOn` forces Gradle to assume that _every_ file produced by a prerequisite task is needed by this task.
This can lead to unnecessary task execution and decreased build performance.

=== Example

Here is a task that writes output to two separate files:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidDependsOn/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=depended-upon-task-setup]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidDependsOn/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=depended-upon-task-setup]"]
====

<1> *Task With Multiple Outputs*: `hellowWorld` task prints "Hello" to its `messageFile` and "World" to its `audienceFile`.
<2> *Registering the Task*: `hellowWorld` produces "message.txt" and "audience.txt" outputs.

==== Don't Do This

If we want to translate the greeting in the `message.txt` file using another task, we could do this:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidDependsOn/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=avoid-this]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidDependsOn/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=avoid-this]"]
====

<1> *Translation Task Setup*: `translateBad` requires `helloWorld` to run first to produce the message file otherwise it will fail with an error as the file does not exist.
<2> *Explicit Task Dependency*: Running `translateBad` will cause `helloWorld` to run first, but Gradle does not understand _why_.

==== Do This Instead

Instead, we should explicitly wire task inputs and outputs like this:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidDependsOn/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=do-this]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/bestPractices/avoidDependsOn/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=do-this]"]
====

<1> *Register Implicit Task Dependency*: `translateGood` requires only one of the files that is produced by `helloWorld`.
Gradle now understands that `translateGood` requires `helloWorld` to have run successfully first because it needs to create the `message.txt` file which is then used by the translation task.
Gradle can use this information to optimize task scheduling.
