[[dependency-configurations]]
= Declaring Dependency Configurations

[[sec:what-are-dependency-configurations]]
In Gradle, dependencies are associated with specific scopes, such as compile-time or runtime.
These scopes are represented by configurations, each identified by a unique name.

Gradle plugins often add pre-defined link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration.html[configurations] to your project.

For example, when applied, the Java plugin adds configurations to your project for source code compilation (`implementation`), test execution (`testImplementation`), and more (`api`, `compileOnly`, `runtimeOnly`, etc.):

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/artifacts/dependencyBasics/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=configurations]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/artifacts/dependencyBasics/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=configurations]"]
====

This example highlights dependencies declared on the `implementation`, `testImplementation`, and `api` configuration for a Java project.
See the <<java_plugin.adoc#sec:java_plugin_and_dependency_management,Java plugin documentation>> for details.

[[sec:resolvable-consumable-configs]]
== Resolvable and consumable configurations

Configurations aren't used just for declaring dependencies, they serve various roles in dependency management:

1. *Declaring Dependencies Role*: Configurations that define a set of dependencies.
2. *Consumer Role*: Configurations that are used to resolve dependencies into artifacts.
3. *Producer Role*: Configurations that expose artifacts for consumption by other projects.

=== 1. Configurations for declaring dependencies (i.e, declarable configuration)

To declare dependencies in your project, you can use or create *declarable configurations*.
These configurations help organize and categorize dependencies for different parts of the project.

For example, to express a dependency on another project, you would use a *declarable configurations* like `implementation`:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=declare-configuration]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=declare-configuration]"]
====

*Configurations used for declaring dependencies* define and manage the specific libraries or projects your code requires for tasks such as compilation or testing.

=== 2. Configurations for consumers (i.e, resolvable configuration)

To control how dependencies are resolved and used within your project, you can use or create **resolvable configurations**.
These configurations define classpaths and other sets of artifacts that your project needs during different stages, like compilation or runtime.

For example, the `implementation` configuration declares the dependencies, while `compileClasspath` and `runtimeClasspath` are **resolvable configurations** designed for specific purposes.
When resolved, they represent the classpaths needed for compilation and runtime, respectively:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=concrete-classpath]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=concrete-classpath]"]
====

*Resolvable configurations* are those that can be resolved to produce a set of files or artifacts.
These configurations are used to define the classpath for different stages of a build process, such as compilation or runtime.

=== 3. Configurations for producers (i.e., consumable configuration)

**Consumable configurations** are used to expose artifacts to other projects.
These configurations define what parts of your project can be consumed by others, like APIs or runtime dependencies, but are not meant to be resolved directly within your project.

For example, the `exposedApi` configuration is a **consumable configuration** that exposes the API of a component to consumers:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=setup-configurations]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=setup-configurations]"]
====

A library typically provides consumable configurations like `apiElements` (for compilation) and `runtimeElements` (for runtime dependencies).
These configurations expose the necessary artifacts for other projects to consume, without being resolvable within the current project.
The `canBeDeclared`, `isCanBeConsumed` and `isCanBeResolved` flags help distinguish the roles of these configurations.

== Configuration flags and roles

Configurations have three key flags:

- **`canBeResolved`:** Indicates that this configuration is intended for resolving a set of dependencies into a dependency graph. A resolvable configuration should not be declarable or consumable.
- **`canBeConsumed`:** Indicates that this configuration is intended for exposing artifacts outside this project. A consumable configuration should not be declarable or resolvable.
- **`canBeDeclared`:** Indicates that this configuration is intended for declaring dependencies. A declarable configuration should not be resolvable or consumable.

TIP: Configurations should only have one of these flags enabled.

In short, a configuration's role is determined by the `canBeResolved`, `canBeConsumed`, or `canBeDeclared` flag:

[cols="2,1,1,1"]
|===
|Configuration role|Can be resolved|Can be consumed|Can be declared

|Dependency Scope|false|false|true
|Resolve for certain usage|true|false|false
|Exposed to consumers|false|true|false
|Legacy, don't use|true|true|true
|===

For backwards compatibility, the flags have a default value of `true`, but as a plugin author, you should always determine the right values for those flags, or you might accidentally introduce resolution errors.

This example demonstrates how to manually declare the core Java configurations (normally provided by the <<java_plugin.adoc#java_plugin,Java plugin>>) in Gradle:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=java-configuration-example]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/attributeMatching/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=java-configuration-example]"]
====

The following configurations are created:

- `implementation`: Used for declaring project dependencies but neither consumed nor resolved.
- `compileClasspath` + `runtimeClasspath`: Resolvable configurations that collect compile-time and runtime dependencies from `implementation`.
- `exposedApi` + `exposedRuntime`: Consumable configurations that expose artifacts (API and runtime) to other projects, but aren’t meant for internal resolution.

This setup mimics the behavior of the `implementation`, `compileClasspath`, `runtimeClasspath`, `apiElements`, and `runtimeElements` configurations in the <<java_plugin.adoc#java_plugin,Java plugin>>.

[[sec:defining-custom-configurations]]
== Creating custom configurations

You can define custom configurations to declare separate scopes of dependencies for specific purposes.

Suppose you want to generate Javadocs with AsciiDoc formatting embedded within your Java source code comments.
By setting up the `asciidoclet` configuration, you enable Gradle to use Asciidoclet, allowing your Javadoc task to produce HTML documentation with enhanced formatting options:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/java/basic/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=create-custom-doclet]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/java/basic/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=create-custom-doclet]"]
====

You can manage custom configurations using the `configurations` block.
Configurations must have names and can extend each other.
For more details, refer to the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ConfigurationContainer.html[`ConfigurationContainer`] API.

NOTE: Configurations are intended to be used for a single role: declaring dependencies, performing resolution, or defining consumable variants.

There are three main use cases for creating custom configurations:

1. **API/Implementation Separation:** Create custom configurations to separate API dependencies (exposed to consumers) from implementation dependencies (used internally during compilation or runtime).
- You might create an `api` configuration for libraries that consumers will depend on, and an `implementation` configuration for libraries that are only needed internally. The `api` configuration is typically consumed by downstream projects, while `implementation` dependencies are hidden from consumers but used internally.
- This separation ensures that your project maintains clean boundaries between its public API and strictly internal mechanisms.

2. **Resolvable Configuration Creation**: Create a custom resolvable configuration to resolve specific sets of dependencies, like classpaths, at various build stages.
- You might create a `compileClasspath` configuration that resolves only the dependencies needed to compile your project. Similarly, you could create a `runtimeClasspath` configuration to resolve the dependencies needed to run the project at runtime.
- This allows fine-grained control over which dependencies are available during different build phases, such as compilation or testing.

3. **Consumable Configuration from Dependency Configuration**: Create a custom consumable configuration to expose artifacts or dependencies for other projects to consume, typically when your project produces artifacts like JARs.
- You might create an `exposedApi` configuration to expose the API dependencies of your project for consumption by other projects. Similarly, a `runtimeElements` configuration could be created to expose the runtime dependencies or artifacts that other projects need.
- Consumable configurations ensure that only the necessary artifacts or dependencies are exposed to consumers.

=== Configuration API incubating methods

Several incubating factory methods—`resolvable()`, `consumable()`, and `dependencyScope()`—within the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/ConfigurationContainer.html[`ConfigurationContainer`] API can be used to simplify the creation of configurations with specific roles.

These methods help build authors document the purpose of a configuration and avoid manually setting various configuration flags, streamlining the process and ensuring consistency:

- **`resolvable()`**: Creates a configuration intended for resolving dependencies. This means the configuration can be used to resolve dependencies but not consumed by other projects.
- **`consumable()`**: Creates a configuration meant to be consumed by other projects but not used to resolve dependencies itself.
- **`dependencyScope()`**: Creates a configuration that establishes a dependency scope, setting up the necessary properties to act both as a consumer and provider, depending on the use case.

[[sub:config-inheritance-composition]]
== Configuration inheritance

Configurations can inherit from other configurations, creating an inheritance hierarchy.

Configurations form an inheritance hierarchy using the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration.html#org.gradle.api.artifacts.Configuration:extendsFrom)[`Configuration.extendsFrom(Configuration...)`] method.
A configuration can extend any other configuration other than a link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.api.artifacts/-configuration-container/detached-configuration[detached configuration], regardless of how it is defined in the build script or plugin.

TIP: Avoid extending consumable or resolvable configurations with configurations that are not consumable or resolvable, respectively.

Configurations can only extend configurations within the same project.

When extending a configuration, the new configuration inherits:

* dependencies
* dependency constraints
* exclude rules
* artifacts
* capabilities

The extension does *not* include attributes. It also does *not* extend consumable/resolvable/declarable status.
