= How to Downgrade Transitive Dependencies in Gradle

This guide explains how to **downgrade transitive dependencies** in Gradle when your project requires an older version due to API compatibility, bugs, or other constraints.

== Why Downgrade a Transitive Dependency?

By default, Gradle **resolves dependency version conflicts** by selecting the latest version found in the dependency graph.
However, there are cases where an earlier version is required:

* A **bug** exists in the latest release.
* Your project **depends on an older API** that is incompatible with newer versions.
* Your code does **not require** the features that demand a higher version.

Before downgrading, consider **updating your source code** to support the latest version instead.

Additionally, you should make sure there aren't existing <<dependency_constraints.adoc#dependency-constraints,dependency constraint>>, <<platforms.adoc#platforms,platforms>>, or <<version_catalogs.adoc#version-catalog,version catalogs>>, that are setting the dependency to an undesired version in your project.

If downgrading is necessary, use **strict dependencies** or **forced dependencies**.

== Option 1: Enforcing a Strict Version of a Dependency

Gradle allows you to enforce a <<dependency_versions.adoc#sec:rich-version-constraints,**strict version**>> for a dependency, ensuring that the selected version cannot be upgraded by transitive dependencies.

=== Step 1: Setting a Strict Version

Suppose a project depends on **HttpClient**, which pulls in **Commons Codec 1.10**, but your project requires **Commons Codec 1.9**:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/how-to/downgrade-transitives/tests",files="dependencies.out"]
====

You can enforce the required version by setting a **strict version constraint**:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/how-to/downgrade-transitives/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=dependency-full]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/how-to/downgrade-transitives/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=dependency-full]"]
====

Running `./gradlew dependencies --configuration runtimeClasspath` showcases the results:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/how-to/downgrade-transitives/tests",files="dependencies-downgrade.out"]
====

Important notes about strict versions:

- A **strict version behaves like a force**, meaning it overrides transitive dependencies.
- If another dependency **requires a higher version**, Gradle **will fail** with a resolution error.
- Use **version ranges** instead of absolute strict versions to allow flexibility.

=== Step 2: Setting a Strict Version Range

Instead of locking to a single version, define a **strict range**:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/how-to/downgrade-transitives/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=dependency-full-prefer]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/how-to/downgrade-transitives/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=dependency-full-prefer]"]
====

If another dependency requires **1.10**, Gradle can resolve it without failure, as long as it falls within the specified range.

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/how-to/downgrade-transitives/tests",files="dependencies-extra.out"]
====

== Option 2: Forcing a Version at the Configuration Level

If a strict dependency is **too restrictive**, you can **force** a specific version for an entire configuration using link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.artifacts.ResolutionStrategy.html[`resolutionStrategy.force()`].

=== Step 1: Forcing a Version for the Entire Build

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/how-to/downgrade-transitives/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=dependency-configs]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/how-to/downgrade-transitives/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=dependency-configs]"]
====

Running `./gradlew dependencies --configuration compileClasspath` showcases the results:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/how-to/downgrade-transitives/tests",files="dependencies-config.out"]
====

This ensures that **Commons Codec 1.9 is always used**, even if transitive dependencies request a newer version.

== Summary

To review the two options:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Approach | Behavior

| 1. *Strict version (link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/dsl/DependencyHandler.html[`strictly()`])*
| The version is enforced but can trigger resolution failures if conflicts exist.

| 2. *Forced version (link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/ResolutionStrategy.html#force(java.lang.Object...)[`force()`])*
| The version is forcibly applied at the configuration level, overriding all other constraints.
|===

In summary:

- **Use strict versions** if you need to enforce an older version and want to control compatibility.
- **Use version ranges** with a preferred version to allow some flexibility.
- **Use `force()` at the configuration level** when you need to override transitive dependencies without strict constraints.
