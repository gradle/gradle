= Graph Resolution

During the _graph resolution_ phase, Gradle constructs a *resolved dependency graph*, which models the relationships between different components and their variants.

== Modules

Graph resolution begins with *dependencies* declared in the build script:

[source,kotlin]
.build.gradle.kts
----
dependencies {
    implementation("com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.17.2")
}
----

In the <<declaring_dependencies.adoc#one-declaring-dependencies,Learning the Basics section>>, we learned that a **module** is a published unit of work (like a library or application), while a **dependency** is a reference to a *module* required for a project to compile or run.

In the example above, the *module* is link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind[`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind`].

[[sec:components]]
== Components

Each version of a *module* is referred to as a *component*.

In the example above for the link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind/2.17.2[`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.17.2`] *module*, `2.17.2` is the version.

== Metadata

A *component* is detailed by *metadata*, which is available in the repository where the *component* is hosted as a `ivy`, `pom`, or link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/jackson-databind/2.17.2/jackson-databind-2.17.2.module[`GMM`] metadata.

Here’s a condensed sample of the *metadata* for link:https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/jackson-databind/2.17.2/jackson-databind-2.17.2.module[`com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.17.2`]:

[source,json]
.jackson-databind-2.17.2.module
----
{
  "formatVersion": "1.1",
  "component": {
    "group": "com.fasterxml.jackson.core",
    "module": "jackson-databind",
    "version": "2.17.2"
  },
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "apiElements",
      ...
    },
    {
      "name": "runtimeElements",
      "attributes": {
        "org.gradle.category": "library",
        "org.gradle.dependency.bundling": "external",
        "org.gradle.libraryelements": "jar",
        "org.gradle.usage": "java-runtime"
      },
      "dependencies": [
        {
          "group": "com.fasterxml.jackson.core",
          "module": "jackson-annotations",
          "version": {
            "requires": "2.17.2"
          }
        }
      ],
      "files": [
        {
          "name": "jackson-databind-2.17.2.jar"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
----

Some items in the file should be familiar to you such as "files", "dependencies", "components", "module" and "version".
Let's focus on the *variants* provided in the *metadata*.

== Variants

A *variant* is a specific variation of a *component* tailored for a particular use case or environment.

*Variants* allow you to provide different definitions of your *component* depending on the context in which it’s used.

As detailed above, the *metadata* of the `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.17.2` *component* offers two *variants*:

- The `apiElements` *variant* includes dependencies required for compiling projects against Jackson Databind.
- The `runtimeElements` *variant* includes dependencies required for executing Jackson Databind during runtime.

|===
| Variant | Dependencies | Artifacts

| `apiElements`
| `com.fasterxml.jackson.core`, `com.fasterxml.jackson.bom`
| `jackson-databind-2.17.2.jar`

| `runtimeElements`
| `com.fasterxml.jackson.core`
| `jackson-databind-2.17.2.jar`

| ... other variant ...
| ... some dependencies ...
| ... some artifacts ...
|===

Each *variant* consists of a set of *artifacts* and defines a set of *dependencies* (i.e. seen as transitive dependencies of the build):

* The `runtimeElements` *variant* of `com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.17.2`:
** Depends on `com.fasterxml.jackson.core`.
** Provides an artifact called `jackson-databind-2.17.2.jar`.

To differentiate between the `apiElements` and `runtimeElements` variants, Gradle uses *attributes*.

== Attributes

To differentiate between *variants*, Gradle uses *attributes*.

*Attributes* are used to define specific characteristics or properties of *variants* and the context in which those *variants* should be used.

In the *metadata* for Jackson Databind, we see that the `runtimeElements` *variant* is described by the `org.gradle.category`, `org.gradle.dependency.bundling`, `org.gradle.libraryelement`, and `org.gradle.usage` *attributes*:

[source,json]
----
{
  "variants": [
    {
      "name": "runtimeElements",
      "attributes": {
        "org.gradle.category": "library",
        "org.gradle.dependency.bundling": "external",
        "org.gradle.libraryelements": "jar",
        "org.gradle.usage": "java-runtime"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

*Attributes* are defined as `key:value` pairs, such as `org.gradle.category": "library"`.

Now that we understand the building blocks for dependency management, let's look into graph resolution.

== Dependency Graph

Gradle builds a dependency graph that represents a configuration's *dependencies* and their relationships.
This graph includes both direct and transitive *dependencies*.

The graph is made up of _nodes_ where each _node_ represents a *variant*.
These _nodes_ are connected by edges, representing the dependencies between *variants*.
The edges indicate how one *variant* relies on another.

The `dependencies` task can be used to _partially_ visualize the structure of a dependency graph:

[source,text]
----
$ ./gradlew app:dependencies

[...]

runtimeClasspath - Runtime classpath of source set 'main'.
\--- com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.17.2
     +--- com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations:2.17.2
     |    \--- com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson-bom:2.17.2
     |         +--- com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations:2.17.2
     |         +--- com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core:2.17.2
     |         \--- com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.17.2
     +--- com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core:2.17.2
     |    \--- com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson-bom:2.17.2
     \--- com.fasterxml.jackson:jackson-bom:2.17.2
----

In this truncated output, `runtimeClasspath` represents the specific resolvable configurations in the project.

*Each resolvable configuration calculates a separate dependency graph.*
That's because different configurations can resolve to a different set of transitive dependencies for the same set of declared dependencies.

In the example above, the resolvable configuration, `compileClasspath` could resolve a different set of dependencies and produce a very different graph than `runtimeClasspath`.

So how does Gradle build the dependency graph?

== Graph Resolution Flow

Graph resolution operates on a _node-by-node_ (i.e., *variant*-by-*variant*) basis.

Each iteration of the loop processes one _node_ at a time, starting by de-queuing a _node_.

In the beginning, the queue is empty.
When the process starts, a _root node_ added to the queue.
The _root node_ is effectively the resolvable configuration:

image::dep-man-adv-2.png[]

Gradle starts the loop by pulling the _root node_ from the queue.
Gradle examines the *dependencies* of the _root node_, resolves their conflicts, and downloads their *metadata*.
Based on their *metadata*, Gradle selects *variants* of those dependencies and adds them back to the queue.

[[note]]
NOTE: The _root_ *variant's* dependencies correspond to the declared *dependencies* of the resolvable configuration.

At this point, the queue contains all selected *variants* for the _root node's_ *dependencies*, which will now be processed one by one.

For each node in the loop Gradle:

1. Evaluates its *dependencies*.
2. Determines their targeted versions using <<sec:conflict-resolution,conflict resolution>>.
3. <<sec:how-gradle-downloads-deps,Downloads the *metadata*>> for all *components* at once.
4. <<sec:variant-selection,Select *variants*>> for each of those *components*.
5. Adds the *variants* to the top-level queue.

The loop is repeated until the node queue is empty.
Once the process is complete, the <<sec:resolved-dep-graph,dependency graph is resolved>>.

TIP: Graph resolution alternates between parallel metadata downloads and single-threaded logic, repeating this pattern over and over again for a single graph.

[[sec:conflict-resolution]]
== Conflict Resolution

When performing dependency resolution, Gradle handles two types of conflicts:

A. **Version conflicts**: Which occur when multiple dependencies request the same dependency but with different versions.
Gradle must choose which version to include in the graph.
B. **Implementation / Capability conflicts**: Which occur when the dependency graph contains different modules that provide the same functionality or _capability_.
Gradle resolves these by selecting one module to avoid duplicate implementations.

The dependency resolution process is highly customizable and many APIs can influence the process.

[[sec:version-conflict]]
=== A. Version conflicts

A version conflict can occur when two components:

* Depend on the same module, such as `com.google.guava:guava`
* But on different versions, for example, `20.0` and `25.1-android`:
** Our project directly depends on `com.google.guava:guava:20.0`
** Our project also depends on `com.google.inject:guice:4.2.2`, which in turn depends on `com.google.guava:guava:25.1-android`

[[sec:resolution-strategy]]
Gradle must resolve this conflict by selecting one version to include in the dependency graph.

Gradle considers all requested versions across the dependency graph and, by default, selects the _highest_ version.
Detailed version ordering is explained in <<dependency_versions.adoc#sec:version-ordering,version ordering>>.

Gradle also supports the concept of <<dependency_versions.adoc#sec:rich-version-constraints,rich version declarations>>, which means that what constitutes the "highest" version depends on how the versions were declared:

* **Without ranges**: The highest non-rejected version will be selected.
** If a `strictly` version is declared that is lower than the highest, resolution will fail.
* **With ranges**:
** If a non-range version fits within the range or is higher than the upper bound, it will be selected.
** If only ranges exist, the selection depends on the intersection of those ranges:
*** If ranges overlap, the highest _existing_ version in the intersection is selected.
*** If no clear intersection exists, the highest version from the largest range will be selected. If no version exists in the highest range, the resolution fails.
** If a `strictly` version is declared that is lower than the highest, resolution will fail.

For version ranges, Gradle needs to perform intermediate metadata lookups to determine what variations are available, as explained in <<#sec:how-gradle-downloads-deps>>.

[[sec:base-version-comparison]]
==== Versions with qualifiers

The term "qualifier" refers to the portion of a version string that comes after a non-dot separator, like a hyphen or underscore.

For example:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Original version | Base version | Qualifier

|1.2.3
|1.2.3
|<none>

|1.2-3
|1.2
|3

|1_alpha
|1
|alpha

|abc
|abc
|<none>

|1.2b3
|1.2
|b3

|abc.1+3
|abc.1
|3

|b1-2-3.3
|b
|1-2-3.3
|===

As you can see separators are any of the `.`, `-`, `_`, `+` characters, plus the empty string when a numeric and a non-numeric part of the version are next to each-other.

By default, Gradle gives preference to versions without qualifiers when resolving conflicts.

For example, in version `1.0-beta`, the base form is `1.0`, and `beta` is the qualifier.
Versions without qualifiers are considered more stable, so Gradle will prioritize them.

Here are a few examples to clarify:

- `1.0.0` (no qualifier)
- `1.0.0-beta` (qualifier: `beta`)
- `2.1-rc1` (qualifier: `rc1`)

Even if the qualifier is lexicographically higher, Gradle will typically consider a version like `1.0.0` higher than `1.0.0-beta`.

When resolving conflicts between versions, Gradle applies the following logic:

1. **Base version comparison:** Gradle first selects versions with the highest base version, ignoring any qualifiers.
All others are discarded.
2. **Qualifier handling:** If there are still multiple versions with the same base version, Gradle picks one with a preference for versions without qualifiers (i.e., release versions).
If all versions have qualifiers, Gradle will consider the qualifier's order, preferring more stable ones like "release" over others such as "beta" or "alpha."

[[sec:implementation-conflict]]
=== B. Implementation / Capability conflicts

<<component_capabilities.adoc#sec:selecting-between-candidates,Conflicts>> arise in the following scenarios:

- **Incompatible variants**: When two modules attempt to select different, incompatible variants of a dependency.
- **Same capability**: When multiple modules declare the same <<variant_attributes.adoc#variant-attributes,capability>>, creating an overlap in functionality.

This type of conflict is resolved during <<sec:variant-selection, Variant Selection>> described below.

[[sec:how-gradle-downloads-deps]]
== Metadata Retrieval

Gradle requires module metadata in the dependency graph for two reasons:

A. **Determining existing versions for dynamic dependencies**: When a dynamic version (like `1.+` or `latest.release`) is specified, Gradle must identify the concrete versions available.

B. **Resolving module dependencies for a specific version**: Gradle retrieves the dependencies associated with a module based on the specified version, ensuring the correct transitive dependencies are included in the build.

=== A. Determining existing versions for dynamic dependencies

When faced with a dynamic version, Gradle must identify the available concrete versions through the following steps:

1. **Inspecting repositories**: Gradle checks each defined repository in the order they were added. It doesn't stop at the first one that returns metadata but continues through all available repositories.

2. **Maven repositories**: Gradle retrieves version information from the `maven-metadata.xml` file, which lists available versions.

3. **Ivy repositories**: Gradle resorts to a directory listing to gather available versions.

The result is a list of candidate versions that Gradle evaluates and matches to the dynamic version.
Gradle <<dependency_caching.adoc#sec:controlling-dynamic-version-caching,caches>> this information to optimize future resolution.
At this point, <<#sec:resolution-strategy,version conflict resolution>> is resumed.

=== B. Resolving module dependencies for a specific version

When Gradle tries to resolve a required dependency with a specific version, it follows this process:

1. **Repository inspection**: Gradle checks each repository in the order they are defined.
- It looks for metadata files describing the module (`.module`, `.pom`, or `ivy.xml`), or directly for artifact files.
- Modules with metadata files (`.module`, `.pom`, or `ivy.xml`) are prioritized over those with just an artifact file.
- Once metadata is found in a repository, subsequent repositories are ignored.
2. **Retrieving and parsing metadata**: If metadata is found, it is parsed.
- If the POM file has a parent POM, Gradle recursively resolves each parent module.
3. **Requesting artifacts**: All artifacts for the module are fetched from the same repository that provided the metadata.
4. **Caching**: All data, including the repository source and any potential misses, are stored in the <<dependency_caching.adoc#sec:controlling-dynamic-version-caching,dependency cache>> for future use.

[NOTE]
====
The point above highlights a potential issue with integrating <<supported_repository_types.adoc#sec:case-for-maven-local,Maven Local>>. Since Maven Local acts as a Maven cache, it may occasionally miss artifacts for a module. When Gradle sources a module from Maven Local and artifacts are missing, it assumes those artifacts are entirely unavailable.
====

[[sec:repository-disabling]]
=== Repository disabling

When Gradle fails to retrieve information from a repository, it disables the repository for the remainder of the build and fails all dependency resolution.

This behavior ensures reproducibility.

If the build were to continue while ignoring the faulty repository, subsequent builds could produce different results once the repository is back online.

[[sub:http-retries]]
==== HTTP Retries

Gradle will attempt to connect to a repository multiple times before disabling it.
If the connection fails, Gradle retries on specific errors that might be temporary, with increasing wait times between retries.

A repository is marked as unavailable when it cannot be reached, either due to a permanent error or after the maximum number of retries has been exhausted.

[[sec:variant-selection]]
== Variant Selection

Based on the requirements of the build, Gradle selects one of the *variants* of the module present in the *metadata*.

Specifically, Gradle attempts to match the *attributes* from the resolved configuration to those in the *module* *metadata*.

Variant selection and attribute matching is fully described in the <<variant_aware_resolution.adoc#sec:understanding-variant-selection,next section>>.

[[sec:resolved-dep-graph]]
== Available APIs

The link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/result/ResolutionResult.html[`ResolutionResult`] API provides access to the resolved dependency graph without triggering *artifact* downloads.

The graph itself focuses on *component variants*, not the *artifacts* (files) associated with those *variants*:

- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/result/ResolvedComponentResult.html[`ResolvedComponentResult`] - Represents a resolved *component* in the raw dependency graph.
- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/result/ResolvedVariantResult.html[`ResolvedVariantResult`] - Represents a resolved *variant* of a *component* in the raw dependency graph.

Raw access to the dependency graph can be useful for a number of use cases:

- Visualizing the dependency graph, for example generating a `.dot` file for Graphviz.
- Exposing <<viewing_debugging_dependencies.adoc#viewing-debugging-dependencies,diagnostics>> about a given resolution, similar to the `dependencies` or `dependencyInsight` tasks.
- Resolving a subset of the artifacts for a dependency graph when used in conjunction with the `ArtifactView` API.

Consider the following function that traverses a dependency graph, starting from the root node.
Callbacks are notified for each node and edge in the graph.
This function can be used as a base for any use case that requires traversing a dependency graph:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/performingResolution-resolutionResult/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=graph-traversal-function]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/performingResolution-resolutionResult/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=graph-traversal-function]"]
====

This function starts at the root variant, and performs a breadth-first traversal of the graph.
The `ResolutionResult` API is lenient, so it is important to check whether a visited edge is unresolved (failed) or resolved.
With this function, the node callback is always called before the edge callback for any given node.

Below, we leverage the above traversal function to transform a dependency graph into a `.dot` file for visualization:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/performingResolution-resolutionResult/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=define-graph-traversal-task]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/performingResolution-resolutionResult/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=define-graph-traversal-task]"]
====

NOTE: A proper implementation would not use `println` but would write to an output file. For more details on declaring task inputs and outputs, see the <<writing_tasks.adoc#writing_tasks,Writing Tasks>> section.

When we register the task, we use the `ResolutionResult` API to access the root component and root variant of the `runtimeClasspath` configuration:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/performingResolution-resolutionResult/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=register-graph-traversal-task]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/performingResolution-resolutionResult/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=register-graph-traversal-task]"]
====

NOTE: This example uses incubating APIs.

Running this task, we get the following output:

----
include::{snippetsPath}/dependencyManagement/performingResolution-resolutionResult/tests/dot.out[]
----

image::dep-man-adv-3.png[]

Compare this to the output of the `dependencies` task:

----
include::{snippetsPath}/dependencyManagement/performingResolution-resolutionResult/tests/dependencies.out[]
----

Notice how the graph is the same for both representations, the only difference it the chosen *variant* information available in the dot graph.
