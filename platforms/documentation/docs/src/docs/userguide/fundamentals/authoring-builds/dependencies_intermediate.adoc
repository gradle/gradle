= Declaring and Managing Dependencies

Gradle provides a rich and flexible model for declaring dependencies, managing versions, and resolving conflicts across builds.

== Declare Dependencies

The `dependencies{}` block is where you declare the external libraries, internal modules, or files your project needs to compile, run, or test:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/declaringDependencies-basic/kotlin/app",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=java-dependency-mgmt]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/declaringDependencies-basic/groovy/app",files="build.gradle[tags=java-dependency-mgmt]"]
====

Each dependency is added to a **bucket configuration**.
For example `implementation`, `runtimeOnly`, or `testImplementation`—which defines **where** that dependency is used (compile classpath, runtime only, tests, etc.).
The **set of configurations available** depends on the plugins you apply (e.g., `java`/`java-library` vs. Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) or Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)).

Gradle recommends the **single-string notation** for external modules (instead of the map notation), because it’s clearer, more concise, and will fail your build in Gradle 10.

[source,kotlin]
----
dependencies {
    // GOOD: single-string notation
    implementation("com.google.guava:guava:32.1.2-jre")
    // BAD: map notation
    implementation(group = "com.google.guava", name = "guava", version = "32.1.2-jre")
}
----

== Centralize Versions with Version Catalogs

Gradle recommends using version catalogs to declare dependency versions in a single, reusable location:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/init/generated/groovy",files="gradle/libs.versions.toml[]"]
====

You can then use these aliases in your build scripts:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/init/generated/kotlin",files="app/build.gradle.kts[tags=init-dep]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/init/generated/groovy",files="app/build.gradle[tags=init-dep]"]
====

== Enforce and Constrain Versions

Gradle allows you to constrain dependency versions to avoid unwanted upgrades or enforce known good versions:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/how-to/downgrade-transitives/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=dependency-full]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/how-to/downgrade-transitives/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=dependency-full]"]
====

You can also constrain a module globally:

====
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies-versionsWithConstraints/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=dependency-constraints]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/dependencyManagement/managingTransitiveDependencies-versionsWithConstraints/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=dependency-constraints]"]
====

== Resolve Conflicts with Capabilities

Sometimes multiple libraries provide the same functionality under different coordinates. This can lead to classpath conflicts:

[source,kotlin]
----
dependencies {
    implementation("jaxen:jaxen:1.1.6")     // Transitive dependency that brings XPath functionality
    implementation("org.jdom:jdom2:2.0.6")  // Also offers XPath functionality
}

----

Gradle lets you model these cases using capabilities.
For example:

[source,kotlin]
----
dependencies {
    implementation("jaxen:jaxen:1.1.6") {
        capabilities {
            requireCapability("xml:xpath-support")
        }
    }
    implementation("org.jdom:jdom2:2.0.6")
}
----

Then declare capabilities via a component metadata rule:

[source,kotlin]
----
components {
    withModule("jaxen:jaxen") {
        allVariants {
            withCapabilities {
                addCapability("xml", "xpath-support", "1.0")
            }
        }
    }
    withModule("org.jdom:jdom2") {
        allVariants {
            withCapabilities {
                addCapability("xml", "xpath-support", "1.0")
            }
        }
    }
}
----

Gradle will now treat `jaxen` and `jdom2` as alternate implementations and select the one with a required capability.

There are many more ways to influence dependency resolution in Gradle.
