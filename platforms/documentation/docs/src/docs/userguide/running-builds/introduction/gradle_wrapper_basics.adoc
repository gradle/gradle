[[gradle_wrapper_basics]]
= Wrapper Basics

The **recommended way to execute any Gradle build** is with the Gradle Wrapper.

The wrapper script invokes a declared version of Gradle, downloading it beforehand if necessary.

image::wrapper-workflow.png[]

It is available as a `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` file in the project root directory:

[source,text]
----
root
├── gradlew     // THE WRAPPER
├── gradlew.bat // THE WRAPPER
└── ...
----

If your project does not include these files, it is likely *not* a Gradle project—or the wrapper has not been set up yet.

The wrapper is *not* something you download from the internet.
You must generate it by running `gradle wrapper` from a machine with Gradle <<installation.adoc#installation,installed>>.

The wrapper provides the following benefits:

1. *Automatically downloads* and uses a specific *Gradle* version.
2. *Standardizes* a project on *a* given *Gradle version*.
3. *Provisions the same Gradle version for different users* and environments (IDEs, CI servers...).
4. Makes it easy to *run Gradle builds without installing Gradle* manually.

== Using the Gradle Wrapper

It’s important to distinguish between two ways of running Gradle:

1. *Using a system-installed Gradle distribution* — by running the `gradle` command.
2. *Using the Gradle Wrapper* — by running the `gradlew` or `gradlew.bat` script included in a Gradle project.

The Gradle Wrapper is always the recommended to execute a build with the wrapper to ensure a reliable, controlled, and standardized execution of the build.

1. Using a system-installed Gradle distribution:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ gradle build
----

2. Using the Gradle Wrapper:

- Wrapper invocation on a Linux or OSX machine:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew build
----

- Wrapper invocation on Windows PowerShell:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ gradlew.bat build
----

If you want to run the command in a different directory, you must provide the relative path to the wrapper:

[source,bash]
----
$ ../gradlew build
----

The following console output demonstrates the use of the wrapper on a Windows machine, in the command prompt (cmd), for a Java-based project:

[source,bash]
----
$ gradlew.bat build

[[sec:view_the_wrapper]]
== Understanding the wrapper files

The following files are part of the Gradle Wrapper:

[source,text]
----
.
├── gradle
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar  // <1>
│       └── gradle-wrapper.properties   // <2>
├── gradlew // <3>
└── gradlew.bat // <4>
----
<1> `gradle-wrapper.jar`: This is a small JAR file that contains the Gradle Wrapper code. It is responsible for downloading and installing the correct version of Gradle for a project if it's not already installed.
<2> `gradle-wrapper.properties`: This file contains configuration properties for the Gradle Wrapper, such as the distribution URL (where to download Gradle from) and the distribution type (ZIP or TARBALL).
<3> `gradlew`: This is a shell script (Unix-based systems) that acts as a wrapper around `gradle-wrapper.jar`. It is used to execute Gradle tasks on Unix-based systems without needing to manually install Gradle.
<4> `gradlew.bat`: This is a batch script (Windows) that serves the same purpose as `gradlew` but is used on Windows systems.

IMPORTANT: You should never alter these files.

If you want to view or update the Gradle version of your project, use the command line:

[source, bash]
----
$ ./gradlew --version
$ ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version 7.2
----

[source, cmd]
----
$ gradlew.bat --version
$ gradlew.bat wrapper --gradle-version 7.2
----

WARNING: Do not edit the wrapper files manually.

You can consult the <<gradle_wrapper.adoc#gradle_wrapper_reference,Gradle Wrapper reference>> to learn more.
