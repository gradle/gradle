[[settings_file_basics]]
= Settings File Basics

The settings file is the *entry point* of every Gradle project.

image::gradle-basic-3.png[]

The primary purpose of the _settings file_ is to add subprojects to your build.

Gradle supports single and multi-project builds.

- For single-project builds, the settings file is optional.
- For multi-project builds, the settings file is mandatory and declares all subprojects.

[[sec:settings_script]]
== Settings script

The settings file is a script.
It is either a `settings.gradle` file written in Groovy or a `settings.gradle.kts` file in Kotlin.

The link:{groovyDslPath}/index.html[Groovy DSL^] and the link:{kotlinDslPath}/index.html[Kotlin DSL^] are the only accepted languages for Gradle scripts.

The settings file is typically found in the root directory of the project.

Let's take a look at an example and break it down:

====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.settings.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
rootProject.name = "root-project"   // <1>

include("sub-project-a")            // <2>
include("sub-project-b")
include("sub-project-c")
----
<1> Define the project name.
<2> Add subprojects.
=====

[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.settings.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
rootProject.name = 'root-project'   // <1>

include('sub-project-a')            // <2>
include('sub-project-b')
include('sub-project-c')
----
<1> Define the project name.
<2> Add subprojects.
=====
====

=== 1. Define the project name

The settings file defines your project name:

[source]
----
rootProject.name = "root-project"
----

There is only one root project per build.

=== 2. Add subprojects

The settings file defines the structure of the project by including subprojects, if there are any:

[source]
----
include("app")
include("business-logic")
include("data-model")
----
