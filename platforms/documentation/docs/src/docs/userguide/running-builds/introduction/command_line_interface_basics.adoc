[[command_line_interface_basics]]
= Command-Line Interface Basics

The command-line interface is the primary **method of interacting with Gradle** outside the IDE.

Use of the <<gradle_wrapper.adoc#gradle_wrapper_reference, Gradle Wrapper>> is highly encouraged.

Substitute `./gradlew` (in macOS / Linux) or `gradlew.bat` (in Windows) for `gradle` in the following examples.

Executing Gradle on the command line conforms to the following structure:

----
gradle [taskName...] [--option-name...]
----

Options are allowed _before_ and _after_ task names.

----
gradle [--option-name...] [taskName...]
----

If multiple tasks are specified, you should separate them with a space.

----
gradle [taskName1 taskName2...] [--option-name...]
----

Options that accept values can be specified with or without `=` between the option and argument. The use of `=` is recommended.

----
gradle [...] --console=plain
----

Options that enable behavior have long-form options with inverses specified with `--no-`. The following are opposites.

----
gradle [...] --build-cache
gradle [...] --no-build-cache
----

Many long-form options have short-option equivalents. The following are equivalent:

----
gradle --help
gradle -h
----

== Command-line usage

The following sections describe the use of the Gradle command-line interface.
Some plugins also add their own command line options.

[[command_line_executing_tasks]]
=== Executing tasks
To execute a task called `taskName` on the root project, type:

----
$ gradle :taskName
----

This will run the single `taskName` and all of its <<tutorial_using_tasks.adoc#sec:task_dependencies,dependencies>>.

[[disambiguate_task_options_from_built_in_options]]
=== Specify options for tasks
To pass an option to a task, prefix the option name with `--` after the task name:

----
$ gradle taskName --exampleOption=exampleValue
----

Consult the <<command_line_interface.adoc#command_line_interface,Gradle Command Line Interface reference>> to learn more.
