= Part 2: The Build Lifecycle

Learn about the Gradle build lifecycle and what each phase represents.

****
**In this section, you will:**

- Understand the Build Lifecycle
- Register and configure two tasks
- Run the task to view the phases in action
****

[[part2_begin]]
== Step 0. Before you Begin

1. You initialized your Java app in <<partr1_gradle_init.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>>.

== Step 1. Understanding the Build Lifecycle

A Gradle build has three distinct phases:

Phase 1 - Initialization  :: During the initialization phase, Gradle determines which projects will take part in the build, and creates a `Project` instance for each project.

Phase 2 - Configuration  :: During the configuration phase, the `Project` objects are configured using the build scripts of all projects in the build. Gradle determines the set of tasks to be executed.

Phase 3 - Execution  :: During the execution phase, Gradle executes each of the selected tasks.

When Gradle is invoked to execute a task, the lifecycle begins.
Let's see it in action.

== Step 2. Update the Settings File

Add the following line to the top of the Settings file:

.settings.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
println("SETTINGS FILE: This is executed during the initialization phase")
----

== Step 3. Update the Build Script

Add the following lines to the bottom of the Build script:

.app/build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
println("BUILD SCRIPT: This is executed during the configuration phase")

tasks.register("task1"){
    println("REGISTER TASK1: This is executed during the configuration phase")
}

tasks.register("task2"){
    println("REGISTER TASK2: This is executed during the configuration phase")
}

tasks.named("task1"){
    println("NAMED TASK1: This is executed during the configuration phase")
    doFirst {
        println("NAMED TASK1 - doFirst: This is executed during the execution phase")
    }
    doLast {
        println("NAMED TASK1 - doLast: This is executed during the execution phase")
    }
}

tasks.named("task2"){
    println("NAMED TASK2: This is executed during the configuration phase")
    doFirst {
        println("NAMED TASK2 - doFirst: This is executed during the execution phase")
    }
    doLast {
        println("NAMED TASK2 - doLast: This is executed during the execution phase")
    }
}
----

== Step 4. Run a Gradle Task

Run the `task1` task that you registered and configured in Step 3:

[source]
----
$ ./gradlew task1

SETTINGS FILE: This is executed during the initialization phase     //<1>

> Configure project :app
BUILD SCRIPT: This is executed during the configuration phase       //<2>
REGISTER TASK1: This is executed during the configuration phase     //<2>
NAMED TASK1: This is executed during the configuration phase        //<2>

> Task :app:task1
NAMED TASK1 - doFirst: This is executed during the execution phase  //<3>
NAMED TASK1 - doLast: This is executed during the execution phase   //<3>

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 25s
5 actionable tasks: 3 executed, 2 up-to-date
----
<1> *Initialization*: Gradle executes `settings.gradle.kts` to determine the projects to be built and creates a `Project` object for each one.
<2> *Configuration*: Gradle configures each project by executing the `build.gradle.kts` files. It resolves dependencies and creates a dependency graph of all the available tasks.
<3> *Execution*: Gradle executes the tasks passed on the command line and any prerequisite tasks.

It is important to note that while `task1` was configured and executed, `task2` was not.
This is called _task configuration avoidance_ and prevents unnecessary work.

Task configuration avoidance is when Gradle avoids configuring `task2` when `task1` was called and `task1` does NOT depend. on `task2`.
