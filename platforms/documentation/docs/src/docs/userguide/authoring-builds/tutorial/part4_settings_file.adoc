= Part 4: Writing the Settings File

Learn the basics of authoring Gradle by developing the Settings File.

****
**In this section, you will:**

- Understand the Settings object
- Understand the Settings file
- Understand Gradle scripting
****

[[part4_begin]]
== Step 0. Before you Begin

1. You initialized your Java app in <<part1_gradle_init_project.adoc#part1_begin,part 1>>.
2. You understand the Gradle Build Lifecycle from <<part2_build_lifecycle.adoc#part2_begin,part 2>>.
3. You added a subproject and a separate Build in <<part3_multi_project_builds#part3_begin, part3>>.

== Step 1. Gradle scripts

Build scripts and setting files are code.
They are written in Kotlin or Groovy.

You use the link:{kotlinDslPath}[Kotlin DSL], link:{groovyDslPath}[Groovy DSL] and link:{javadocPath}[Gradle APIs] to write the scripts.

The methods that can be used within a Gradle script primarily include:

- Gradle APIs - such as `getRootProject()` from the link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/initialization/Settings.html[Settings API]
- Blocks defined in the DSL - such as the `plugins{}` block from link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.kotlin.dsl/-kotlin-settings-script/index.html[KotlinSettingsScript]
- Extensions defined by Plugins - such as `implementation()` and `api()` provided by the `java` plugin when applied

== Step 2. The `Settings` object

The settings file is the entry point of every Gradle build.

During the initialization phase, Gradle finds the settings file in your project root directory.

When the settings file, `settings.gradle(.kts)`, is found, Gradle instantiates a link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[Settings] object.

One of the purposes of the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[Settings] object is to allow you to declare all the projects to be included in the build.

You can use any of the methods and properties on the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[Settings] interface directly in your settings file.

For example:

[.multi-language-sample]
=====
[source, kotlin]
----
includeBuild("some-build")                         // Delegates to Settings.includeBuild()
reportsDir = findProject("/myInternalProject")     // Delegates to Settings.findProject()
----
=====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
[source, groovy]
----
includeBuild('some-build')                         // Delegates to Settings.includeBuild()
reportsDir = findProject('/myInternalProject')     // Delegates to Settings.findProject()
----
=====

== Step 3. The Settings file

Let's break down the settings file in our project root directory:

[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.settings.gradle.kts
[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {                                                                   // <1>
    id("org.gradle.toolchains.foojay-resolver-convention") version "0.9.0"  // <2>
}

rootProject.name = "authoring-tutorial"                                     // <3>

include("app")                                                              // <4>
include("lib")

includeBuild("gradle/license-plugin")                                       // <5>
----
<1> `plugins({})` from the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.plugin.use.PluginDependenciesSpec.html[PluginDependenciesSpec API]
<2> `id()` method from the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.plugin.use.PluginDependenciesSpec.html[PluginDependenciesSpec API]
<3> `getRootProject()` method from the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[Settings API]
<4> `include()` method from the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[Settings API]
<5> `includeBuild()` method from the link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings.html[Settings API]
=====
[.multi-language-sample]
=====
.settings.gradle
[source, groovy]
----
plugins {                                                                   // <1>
    id 'org.gradle.toolchains.foojay-resolver-convention' version '0.9.0'   // <2>
}

rootProject.name = 'running-tutorial-groovy'                                // <3>

include('app')                                                              // <4>
include('lib')

includeBuild('gradle/license-plugin')                                       // <5>
----
<1> `plugins({})` method from link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.kotlin.dsl/-kotlin-settings-script/index.html[KotlinSettingsScript] in the Kotlin DSL
<2> `id()` method from the link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.plugin.use/-plugin-dependencies-spec/index.html[PluginDependenciesSpec API]
<3> `getRootProject()` method from the link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.api.initialization/-settings/index.html[Settings API]
<4> `include()` method from the link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.api.initialization/-settings/index.html[Settings API]
<5> `includeBuild()` method from the link:{kotlinDslPath}/gradle/org.gradle.api.initialization/-settings/index.html[Settings API]
