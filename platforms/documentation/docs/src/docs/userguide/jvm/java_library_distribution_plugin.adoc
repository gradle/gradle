[[java_library_distribution_plugin]]
= The Java Library Distribution Plugin

The Java library distribution plugin adds support for building a distribution ZIP for a Java library. The distribution contains the JAR file for the library and its dependencies.


[[sec:java_library_distribution_usage]]
== Usage

To use the Java library distribution plugin, include the following in your build script:

.Using the Java library distribution plugin
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/java/javaLibraryDistribution/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=use-plugin]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/java/javaLibraryDistribution/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=use-plugin]"]
====

To define the name for the distribution you have to set the `baseName` property as shown below:

.Configure the distribution name
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/java/javaLibraryDistribution/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=name-conf]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/java/javaLibraryDistribution/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=name-conf]"]
====

The plugin builds a distribution for your library. The distribution will package up the runtime dependencies of the library. All files stored in `src/main/dist` will be added to the root of the archive distribution. You can run “`gradle distZip`” to create a ZIP file containing the distribution.

[[sec:java_library_distribution_tasks]]
== Tasks

The Java library distribution plugin adds the following tasks to the project.

`distZip` — link:{groovyDslPath}/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Zip.html[Zip]::
_Depends on_: `jar`
+
Creates a full distribution ZIP archive including runtime libraries.


[[java_library_distribution_resources]]
== Including other resources in the distribution

All of the files from the `src/dist` directory are copied. To include any static files in the distribution, simply arrange them in the `src/dist` directory, or add them to the content of the distribution.

.Include files in the distribution
====
include::sample[dir="snippets/java/javaLibraryDistribution/kotlin",files="build.gradle.kts[tags=custom-distribution]"]
include::sample[dir="snippets/java/javaLibraryDistribution/groovy",files="build.gradle[tags=custom-distribution]"]
