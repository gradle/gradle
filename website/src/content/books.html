<h1>Books</h1>
Gradleware is proud to be partnered with <a href="http://oreilly.com">O'Reilly</a> for a three eBook series on Gradle. Each book offers value in a stand-alone manner, but book #2 builds on the DSL syntax foundations established in book #1. Book #3 is a set of recipes that uses Gradle as the demonstrative tool for enterprise build automation.

All three books are authored by <a href="http://augusttechgroup.com">Tim Berglund> and <a href="http://ambientideas.com/blog">Matthew McCullough</a> with insights and review from the <a href="people">core Gradle engineering team</a>.

<h2>1: Building and Testing with Gradle</h2>
The <a href="http://bit.ly/gradlebook1">first of these three books]</a> was launched in July of 2011 and is 80 pages of the foundations of Gradle as written by Tim Berglund and Matthew McCullough. It offers descriptions and examples that reinforce the Gradle message that the tool can be approachable for build users while still offering great flexibility and power to build masters.

<h2>2: Build automation DSLs with Gradle</h2>
The second book in the series is currently being written by Matthew McCullough and Tim Berglund and is slated for a late 2011 release.  It incorporates a deeper examination of actually crafting your own DSL and highly custom build using Gradle. Highlights include:

<ul>
    <li>Custom Task Types</li>
    <li>Hooks</li>
    <li>Repositories</li>
    <li>Plugins</li>
    <li>File Operations</li>
    <li>Archive Operations</li>
    <li>Classpath Manipulations</li>
</ul>

<h2>3: Patterns for Enterprise Release Management</h2>
The third book in the series is a system-wide examination of build strategies. That includes build automation patterns currently in use, ones exhibited as best practices for which to aim, and progressive patterns of build automation coming in the near future. These patterns are implemented in Gradle, but have applicability to other build tools too.
