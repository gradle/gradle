<h1>Continous Integration</h1>

Gradle is continously built at the following locations:

<h2>JetBrains Teamcity</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://teamcity.jetbrains.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=bt41">Windows Build</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://teamcity.jetbrains.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=bt107">Linux Build</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Codehaus Bamboo (currently disabled)</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://bamboo.ci.codehaus.org/browse/GRADLE-CORETRUNK">Linux Build</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://bamboo.ci.codehaus.org/browse/GRADLE-NTL">Nightly Build</a> (uploads documentation)</li>
</ul>

<p>As we have had many platform specific issues it is very important for us to have a continuous build for multiple
platforms.</p>
<p>Gradle is built with Gradle, yet none of those CI servers has Gradle or Groovy installed. The Gradle Wrapper makes
    this possible.</p>
