A paragraph about what the feature is.

# Use cases

What are the use cases we are trying to solve with this feature? That is, why should the user care? What's out of scope?

# User visible changes

A spec of the API, DSL or other behaviour that will be visible to the user.

# Integration test coverage

How are we going to test this feature?

# Implementation approach

How do we increment from where we are to where we want to go? How do we do this in a backwards compatible way? How do we do this without regressing performance?

# Open issues

This stuff is never done. This section is to keep track of assumptions and things we haven't figured out yet.
