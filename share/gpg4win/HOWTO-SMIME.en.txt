To use S/MIME certificates for sign and encrypt, you have to define
the trustability of X.509 root certificates.

A root certificate (root CA) is used to check the validity of all
child certificates.  If you trust the root certificate therby you
trust also all underlying certificates.

To avoid that each user must search and install the required root
certificates, and also check and authenticate the trustworthiness of
the same, it is useful to install a system-wide default of the most
important root certificates:

1.  Store the root certificates

     Copy root certificate file to:

        %ProgramData%\GNU\etc\gnupg\trusted-certs

     e.g.:

        C:\ProgramData\GNU\etc\gnupg\trusted-certs

     The corresponding root certificates must be available as files in DER
     format in the above file folder, with the file extension .crt or .der.

     You get the root certificates from the respective CA administrators.
     CA operators often provide their root certificates also on websites
     for download.

     If the above folder is not visible?
     Please read the reference note to the view options [1].


2.  Store intermediate certificates

     Some Certificate Authorities require additional intermediate
     certificates.

     Copy intermediate certificates to:

         %ProgramData%\GNU\etc\gnupg\extra-certs

     e.g.:

         C:\ProgramData\GNU\etc\gnupg\extra-certs

     The format is the same as the root certificates.


3.  Set root trust

     a) Open the following file with a text editor:

        %ProgramData%\GNU\etc\gnupg\trustlist.txt

     e.g.:

        C:\ProgramData\GNU\etc\gnupg\trustlist.txt

     b) Create a new line per root certificate with the corresponding
        fingerprint, such as:

         <FINGERPRINT> S

         You get the fingerprint from the CA operators (often
         available from the website where you can download the root
         certificate).  Alternatively, you can get the fingerprint
         also via the command line tool "sha1sum" from the binary root
         certificate file (those files usually have a suffix of
         ".crt:, ".bin", ".cert" or ".cer"):

           sha1sum < <ROOT-CERTIFICATE-FILE>

         A row that begins with # will be treated as a comment and ignored.
         The end of the file must be followed by an empty row.

         Example of two entries with comments:
           # CN=Wurzel ZS 3,O=Intevation GmbH,C=DE
           A6935DD34EF3087973C706FC311AA2CCF733765B S

           # CN=PCA-1-Verwaltung-02/O=PKI-1-Verwaltung/C=DE
           DC:BD:69:25:48:BD:BB:7E:31:6E:BB:80:D3:00:80:35:D4:F8:A6:CD S

         In some cases it is useful to reduce the criteria for
         checking the root certificate.  To do this, you can set an
         additional flag relax after the S:

         <FINGERPRINT> S relax


3.  Complete Gpg4win installation and restart computer

     a) Enable the option "Root certificate defined or skip configuration".

     b) Complete the Gpg4win installation wizard regular.

     c) Restart your computer! (Required because the DirMngr have to
        read your root certificates from step (1).)

     Now, you have finished your S/MIME configuration successfully.

4.  Review later in Kleopatra: Import and check certificate chains

     Open Kleopatra and import your X.509 certificate chains.  The
     imported certificate chains should appear under the tab "Trusted
     Certificates". Gpg4win recognizes your imported root certificates
     as trusted.

     Problems? Kleopatra doesn't shows your root certificate as
     trusted?  Solutions:

     * Click on the "Redisplay" button in Kleopatra to update the
       certificate view.

     * Add "relax" after the relevant root certificate in the
       trustlist.txt - see step (2).
