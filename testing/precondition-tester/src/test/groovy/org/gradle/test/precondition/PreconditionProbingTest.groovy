/**
 * This class executes a special test suite, checking all the allowed precondition combinations.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each combination can have three outcomes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Successful:</b> the precondition combination could be satisfied.</li>
 *     <li>
 *         <b>Skipped:</b> the precondition combination could <i>not</i> be satisfied.
 *         This is normal, and simply signifies that the precondition is not satisfied on the current system
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <b>Failed:</b> there was an error while checking the combination.
 *         This shouldn't be normal, and needs fixing.
