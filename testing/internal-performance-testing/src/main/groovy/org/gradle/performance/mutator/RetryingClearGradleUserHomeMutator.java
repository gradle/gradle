/**
 * Clone of {@link org.gradle.profiler.mutations.ClearGradleUserHomeMutator} that retries a few times before giving up.
 *
 * <p>
 * Useful with `--no-daemon` single-use daemon mode, where the daemon may not have released all files in the Gradle user home directory
 * after being stopped.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This will become unnecessary once Gradle waits for the daemon to completely shut down before `--stop` exits.
