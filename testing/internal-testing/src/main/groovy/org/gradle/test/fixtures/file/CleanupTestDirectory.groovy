/**
 * Instructs Spock to use {@link CleanupTestDirectoryExtension} to clean up the test directory provided by a
 * {@link org.gradle.test.fixtures.file.TestDirectoryProvider}.  This is to work around the fact that using
 * a test directory provider as a TestRule causes spock to swallow any test failures and the test directory
 * is cleaned up even for failed tests.  {@link CleanupTestDirectoryExtension} on the other hand, registers
 * an interceptor and listener which cleans up the test directory only when the test passes.
 *
 * The annotation needs to know which field is the {@link org.gradle.test.fixtures.file.TestDirectoryProvider}
 * to clean up.  It defaults to "temporaryFolder", which is the field for AbstractIntegrationSpec.  Other specs
 * can set it accordingly using "fieldName".
