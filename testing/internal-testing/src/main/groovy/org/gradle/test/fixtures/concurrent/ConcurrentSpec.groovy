/**
 * A specification that uses multiple test threads. Provides an {@link Executor} and {@link org.gradle.internal.concurrent.ExecutorFactory} implementation.
 *
 * <p>This class maintains a set of <em>instants</em> reached by the test. An instant records the point in time that a test thread reached a certain point of its execution.
 * Once the test threads have completed, you can make assertions about the ordering of the various instants relative to each other. You can also block until a given
 * instant has been reached.
 *
 * <p>The main test thread cannot define instants, except within an {@link #async} block.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: Be careful when using this class with Spock mock objects, as these mocks perform some synchronisation of their own. This means that you may not be testing
 * what you think you are testing.
