/**
 * Indicates a test that is explicitly testing for some failure that is to be fixed later.
 *
 * <p>This annotation replaces {@literal @}{@link groovy.test.NotYetImplemented}.
 * The problem with {@code NotYetImplemented} is that it succeeds no matter what causes the marked test
 * to fail. Tests like that can pass because the expected failure is still present, or even if the
 * expected failure is replaced by some other failure. It's better to write a test that explicitly
 * tests for the expected failure, so when it fails for some other reason, it becomes noticeable.
 * The purpose of this annotation is to keep such tests easy to find in the code.</p>
