# Error messages and suggestions

Traditionally, if an error occurred, the error message and the possible solution were provided to the console via a single String in the corresponding exception.
That meant possible solutions for Problems could be scattered all over the console output.
To improve the user experience, we introduced a new way to provide suggestions.
The idea is to provide a list of suggestions for a problem in the console output.
The suggestions are displayed in the separate "Try"- section of the console output.
The suggestions are collected in the `BuildExceptionReporter` and printed to the console.

In some cases, you still want to keep the old behavior and display the suggestions in the error message.

## Add custom suggestions

1. To add a custom suggestion in the "Try" section of the console output, your exception needs to implement the `ResolutionProvider` interface.
2. That should be it. The suggestion will be displayed in the "Try" section.

## Remove generic suggestions

For some scenarios, it doesn't make sense to display all the generic suggestions we currently have.
E.g. `--stacktrace` for a compilation error is not helpful.

To influence the generic suggestions Gradle displays, the NonGradleCause interface was introduced.
If an exception implements this interface, Gradle will not display the `--stacktrace` option.

Another more targeted interface is `CompilationFailedIndicator`.
This interface is used to indicate that the exception is caused by a compilation failure. 
This will not show the `--stacktrace` option, but it will show the `--info` option since this can help with parameters passed to the compiler.
