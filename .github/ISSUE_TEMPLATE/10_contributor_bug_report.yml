        We receive dozens of issues every week, so to stay productive, we will close issues that don't provide enough information.

        If you need help with Gradle or have a usage question, please reach [our community](http://help.gradle.org/) instead of creating an issue.

        Please open Android-related issues on [the Android Issue Tracker](https://source.android.com/source/report-bugs)
        Please open IntelliJ-related issues on [the JetBrains Issue Tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=IDEA)
        Please open Gradle Native-related issues on [the Gradle Native repository](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-native/issues)

        Provide a self-contained example project as an attached archive or a Github project.
        You can use [the template](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-issue-reproducer) with a Gradle GitHub action set up to showcase your problem.
        In the rare cases where this is infeasible, we will also accept a detailed set of instructions.
        You can also use [Gradle Project Replicator](https://github.com/android/project-replicator) to reproduce the structure of your project.
