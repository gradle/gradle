# The `automations` section lists automations to run on PRs in this repository.
# Each automation has an `if` key that defines conditions to run the automation,
# as well as a `run` key with the actions to do. All the conditions need to be true
# for the actions to run (there is an implicit AND relation between
# the conditions on each line).  Each condition is specified as a Jinja expression.  You
# can also use the constant `true` if you want to always run the actions.

# Each automation is independent of the others.  Every time a PR is opened or changed,
# the conditions are evaluated and the actions are executed one by one in order
# if all the conditions pass.  You can define multiple automations in a .cm file, but
# each automation name should be unique within the file.

            This PR appears to be lacking tests.  Consider adding tests to cover the new functionality.

# To simplify the automations section, some calculations are placed under unique YAML keys defined here.
# Read the "|" not as "or", but as a "pipe", taking the output of the previous command and passing it to the next command.
# This section could also appear ahead of the automations section.
